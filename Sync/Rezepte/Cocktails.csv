The drink was named after a rail line which stretched between Chicago and New York called The Twentieth Century Limited which ran for 65 years. This line was immensely important because trains were the most civilized way to travel at this point in history and this particular line became famous for luxury. First off ticket holders would tread across a red carpet to get on the train and it is believed that the term ""Red Carpet Treatment"" was coined for this reason. The train also boasted a Library, single occupancy sleeping berths and in house maid service."

In the early days of the cocktail renaissance this drink traveled the globe as a ""Bartender's Handshake"" A drink only well known within the industry and therefore if you ordered it you were considered an insider. Decades later this drink went out of fashion and became an obscure cocktail but never quite disappeared thanks to Harry Craddock, head bartender of The American Bar at The Savoy Hotel in London. Craddock's recipe, though, omitted the creme de violet which in my opinion is a shame and persists on some cocktail menus to this day."

The heat of the iron made the mixture froth or ""Flip"" which obviously is what gave this drink it's name. It was considered a drink for Sailors for the first two hundred years of its history. As time went on Colonists would bring the drink which was considered a health tonic across the Atlantic where it gained fame due to its unique mode of preparation. 

The first documentation of the beer-less flip, the preparation we are more familiar with today appears in Jerry Thomas's The Bar-tender's Guide, or how to mix drinks published in 1862. This recipe called for a whole egg beaten with sugar and shaken with a spirit, typically Brandy, Gin or Sherry. The drink was then poured into a small glass and either left ungarnished or sometimes garnished with nutmeg. Then in the 1887 edition of How To Mix Drinks, Thomas included recipes for Flips made in equal proportions, consisting of sugar, egg and spirit lengthened with water."

It was later frequently mentioned on the television program Sex and the City,[15] in which Sarah Jessica Parker's character, Carrie Bradshaw, commonly ordered the drink when out with her girlfriends.

1/2 Simple Syrup";straight;Lime;;"The history of this drink's ingredients is far older than the drink itself. The mixture of Rum, Lime and Sugar traces it's history waaaaay back to the 17th Century when the British began importing it back to England from the west indies. It wasn't very long before the seafaring folk doing the actual importing figured out how delicious it was to make punches by adding these things together. Once imported to England though, only the rich could afford these rarified ingredients. 
Fast Forward to 1740 when British Navy Admiral Edward ""Old Grog"" Vernon ordered that all Rum rations for the men be mixed with Limes (they'd figured out that it was a cure for scurvy by now) and sugar to dilute the potent spirit. At the time England was at war with Spain and now that the British were a little more healthy and a tad more sober than their Spanish counterparts  which  gave them a small advantage. But still the modern day daiquiri wasn't made until...

...Another war with Spain was underway, this time the Spanish-American War around 1898. The story goes that an American mining engineer stationed in Cuba named Jennings Cox created the drink to help protect his workers from Yellow Fever. There were rumors that Cox created the drink at a dinner party when he ran out of Gin and only had Rum left. Several decades after that another man by the name of P.D. Pagliuchi claimed that he was in fact the creator of the Daiquiri and retold the dinner party story. We'll probably never know the true history but we can all mull it over while we're drinking this fantastic cocktail."

I included this cocktail as it is an important one, it gave birth to some very famous variations and for those of you who like cocktails that are drier and on the less sweet tip, you'll enjoy this drink. It is admittedly one of my very favorites.

1 Lime Juice Cordial";It's interesting to note that this drink has a history tied up both with the British Navy and that of Rose's Lime Cordial. Sometime in the 19th century British Naval officers realized that Limes were a great natural cure for scurvy. A brutal and often times deadly disease brought on by Vitamin C deficiency. Rear Admiral Sir Thomas Desmond Gimlette who served between 1879 and 1913 is cited as the namesake of this drink. It was Gimlette who acted as a doctor to sailors and would give them a bit of gin with lime as a way to make the lime juice more palatable as a medication to ward off Scurvy. It had always been a practice for Sailors to mix lime with their Rum rations (dispensed by the Navy) a drink which came to be known as “grog” from this practice the term “Limey” originated. Now on to the Lime Cordial. Rose’s played a central role in the creation of the gimlet. It was created by Scottish entrepreneur Lauchlan Rose in 1867 and was the British Sailor’s top choice for sweetened Lime Juice. Rose patented the process later the same year and that move made him a very rich man as the British Navy passed a law that required all vessels to carry lime juice and serve it as a daily ration to Sailors. Now, the Roses of yesteryear is a far cry from what you get now which is rife with chemicals and additives

There were three barmen in the 1930’s who regularly worked the bar: Eddie Wolke, Will Taylor and Fred Kaufman. All of these men have been at one time or another connected to the creation of the hotel’s signature drink, and truth be told I’m sure all of them have had a hand in the drinks evolution. The earliest mention of this cocktail comes around 1931 from Charles H. Baker’s Gentelman’s Companion and he attributes the drink to Barman Will Taylor. The drink has gone by many names over the years Hotel National, Hotel National de Cuba or sometimes just National Special.

The Cocktail remained popular for a few decades and was first published in Ted Saucier's ""Bottom's Up"" in 1951, and then it slowly sank into obscurity. 

Then in 2005 a bartender by the name of Murray Stenson found it in Saucier's book and tried it out. He liked it so much that he put it on the menu at the Zig-Zag Cafe in Seattle. People loved the drink so much, it eventually spread to New York City and found itself on the menu at the Pegu Club and the rest is history. "

The Cocktail was created by Trader Vic Bergeron (possibly) and was first seen in print in his Bartender's Guide published in 1947. The build of this drink is a Daiquiri but instead of using simple syrup he subbed out for a little more dimension by adding Falernum and Curacao, making it a bit drier and spicy sweet. "

Kina Lillet is a quinquina, a type of bitter aperitif made with cinchona bark. It was a key component in the original recipe but was discontinued in the late 1960s.

The best substitute for the Kina Lillet is Cocchi Americano, an Italian aperitif made with a base of Moscato wine macerated with herbs, spices, gentian root and cinchona bark. It has a herbal complexity with a soft sweetness and a bitter bite. Using Cocchi Americano in a Vesper creates a cocktail that is dry, bright and citrusy, with a very subtle bitter note.

If you don’t have Cocchi but do have a bottle of Lillet Blanc then simply add a few dashes of Angostura Bitters - it won’t look like the most pristine Vesper but it will improve it’s flavour profile compared to that of Lillet on it’s own."

In this era it was very common and quite fashionable to sip Pastis (Anise Liqueur without the Wormwood) and the cocktail takes it's name from the visual opacity of the drink. This effect is referred to as ""Louching""  which occurs naturally when any anise liqueur meets water. This brings me to a small note on my execution of this cocktail:  I used an atomizer to wash the glass with Absinthe as it is much more aromatic and you get a better more even note of Anise. "

The Tom Collins has probably one of the most interesting Origin Stories of any Classic Cocktail. Most people know that the Tom Collins is a Gin Sour served in a tall glass topped with Soda water, but what people don't know is that it's associated with a terrible joke played on the people of New York in 1874. Here's how it went:
A man would approach his friend and ask, ""Have you seen Tom Collins?""

""Why no!"" the second man would say. ""I have never made his acquaintance.""

""Perhaps you had better do so, and as quick as you can, for he is talking about you in a very rough manner — calling you hard names, and convincing people there is nothing you wouldn't steal short of a red-hot stove.""

This would upset the second man, who would stomp off to go looking for this rascal Tom Collins, upon getting to the bar the man would ask the bartender, ""Do you know a man by the name Tom Collins who has been spreading all sorts of rumors here today?"" The bartender would then reply that he did and would go get him, returning with the Tom Collins drink and serving it to the unsuspecting victim. It was sort of like a 1800's version of punked. Lame as it is, reports are that the practice was quite widespread and of course the drink has persisted since."

But if you see it for what it really is, you'll see that it's simply a sour template where the main spirit is split into four with a little dry Cointreau to temper the sweet. Now given that we're in a time when cocktails are thought of in a more culinary way and there's a lot of innovation going on it's easy to see why this drink get's lost in the shuffle, it really isn't very balanced and it is a lot of sweet on sweet on sweet. That said, it is somewhat of a guilty pleasure, it is a household name that is called often, will continue to be called in bars today, Highball drinks are back in fashion and therefore worth our consideration. If you are working in a bar today (and really even if you're not) you may as well know how to make a Long Island Iced Tea, and if you're going to learn that, you may as well learn all the major variations too. There are easily another five variations on this drink, using the same template and changing the modifier and the lengthener. 

The Long Island came into being the way a lot of cocktails do: A company wanted to sell a product so created a competition for bartenders to push the product. In this case it was Triple Sec and the guy who entered the competition was a bartender named Robert ""Rosebud"" Butt who worked at the Oak Beach Inn on Long Island, NY around 1972. There is a somewhat similar drink which claims to be the genesis of the Long Island created during Prohibition by a guy known as Old Man Bishop in a community called Long Island in Kingsport Tennessee. The drink is said to have been perfected by Ransom Bishop (Old Man Bishop's Son) and it consisted of various amounts of the major four liquors with the addition of Whiskey and Maple Syrup. I don't have the specs on this one, just the story which seems unlikely as it wouldn't have been created in the 1920's, lay dormant for 50 years then all of a sudden spike in popularity. But I guess it could have provided inspiration to Mr. Butt if he;'d known about it. All of this is just conjecture, there's really no way to know!"

By some accounts it was first developed in the 1500's (or a version of it was) making it the oldest cocktail in history, it even predates the word cocktail by some 200 years. The story goes like this: Sir Francis Drake and his men landed on the island of Cuba to sack it and take it's gold. Although the invasion proved fruitless, an associate of Francis' named Richard Drake created an early version of this drink called ""El Draque"" out of aguardiente ( a crude form of early rum), sugar lime and mint. Is this story bullshit? we may never know, but it is interesting. What we know or sure is that the creation date is set at 1928 at a bar called Sloppy Joe's in Havana Cuba. It is the National drink of Cuba and became famous in part because of Ernest Hemmingway's love for it. "

Now the swizzle itself predates the cocktail. It was first mentioned in print in the wonderfully titled ""A Classical Dictionary Of Vulgar Tounge"" by Francis Gross published in 1788. The book references Swizzles to have been around since at least 1760 at a place called ""The Swizzle Club"". 

Swizzles are mentioned as a Carribean style drink named more for the tool used to make it (The Swizzle Stick) than from any of it's ingredients."

While alive Ramos kept the recipe for this drink close to his chest and history is split on whether or not his made it public knowledge before his death, there is a chance that the Ramos as we know it isn't the original recipe."

Actually for a lot of their early history they were considered and referred to as medicine. It wasn’t until the late 1700’s in America that the tide began to change and the Julep was something that went from being a drink given for specific ailments to one that was drunk for fun. This early Juleps actually tended to resemble a Sling more than anything else but in 1802 is the first recorded evidence of Mint going into the Julep and even then it was referred to as a “Mint Sling.” According to David Wondrich there was a time when “people fought the good fight and called a Sling a Sling, but by the 1920’s it had become a Julep for good.” 

The Prescription Julep was first Published in serial Harper’s Monthly ran in 1857 titled “A Winter in The South.” Although I have tasted a lot of Julep variations in my day this one is one of the tastiest for my money. The Cognac mellows the rye a bit and the Rye gives the Cognac a bit of spice. A win win for the drink and as the imbibers for us too!"

The original also called for sour mix so I opted for a house made sour mix with equal parts of lemon, lime and simple.

The Singapore Sling was his bid to create a drink especially for the ladies. Soon word spread far and wide making the drink more and more popular. Ngiam wanted to keep the recipe a secret so he locked it up in a safe and when he passed away, the bartenders were lucky enough to be able to retrieve the recipe with the help of his relatives. The safe and the recipe were then put on display in a glass case at Raffels as an ode to this most famous drink.

So the first one was used as a Corpse Reviver style cocktail (HA!). The cocktail Beach made contained so much alcohol, disguised by fruit juice that the customer complained that the drink had made him a Zombie for several days. In fact when it went on the menu, customers were only allowed a maximum of two. The Zombie was a hit and soon other tiki establishments which began to pop up tried their hand at their own versions, but since Beach was notorious for making proprietary mixes whose ingredients were kept secret, everyone had to try and decode the mix. So now we have several different recipes for a Zombie over time. Thanks to the work of Jeff ""Beachbum"" Berry who worked tirelessly to decode Beach's recipe, we believe we have the Original version here."

This cocktail is a Modern Classic created by the godfather of the 1980's London Cocktail Scene. The late Dick Bradsell was known as the sort of British version of Dale DeGroff and was most famous for not only using fresh ingredients at a time when club culture was king and everyone was using Roses Lime Juice and other chemical laden ingredients, but also for his innovative cocktails. He is the creator of not only the Bramble but also the Russian Spring Punch, the Vodka + Espresso (better known as the espresso Martini) the Treacle and the Wibble. He bartended at some of the most exclusive spots in London and it is rumored that he invented his Vodka+Espresso (Espresso Martini) when model Heidi Klum asked him for something that would ""wake me up and fuck me up""."

The drink wasn't seen in print until 1917, where it was first recorded in the book ""The Ideal Bartender"" by Thomas Bullock. His recipe reads:

Fill Large Bar Glass with Fine Ice
2 Pony Raspberry Syrup
2 Jigger Dry Gin
1 Jigger French Vermouth
White of One Egg
Shake Well, Strain into Cocktail Glass and Serve.

Most modern recipes you'll find in bars have taken the dry vermouth out of the equation which I think is a big mistake."

The modern cocktail traces it's lineage to a drink called a bittered sling. Before distillation became an art in this country, a lot of the spirits we were serving were rough and mean and needed a little doctoring to be palatable enough to drink and not hate yourself for it. So people used to mix their spirits with a little dash of bitters, a little water and a lump of sugar, literally ""a spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down""...if I'm going to quote Mary Poppins. As time went on Bartenders began getting their hands on more rarefied ingredients from Europe such as Cointreau or Curacao, Maraschino liqueur and absinthe. It wasn't long before these new ingredients found their way into those bittered slings as a way of improving upon them. Then as time went on and owing to the idea that this cocktail wasn't that popular, the Old Fashioned was born when people started asking for a drink ""In The Old Fashioned Way"" so as not to get a drink with fruit garnishes and newfangled European spirits. This cocktail though became an entire category of drinks when published in the second Edition of Jerry Thomas' How to Mix Drinks around 1867 (?) and it never quite caught on. That being said this cocktail category ( it can be done with any main spirit) was at some point dusted off by the modern bartender and it has once again found it's way into the conversation."

This cocktail is sometimes classified as a Manhattan variation with the benedictine standing in for Sweet Vermouth, but if you look at the build specs, you'll notice that the build and presentation is that of an Old Fashioned variation or if you want to get super technical, a variation on an improved whiskey cocktail with Benedictine standing in for Maraschino (or orange curacao)."

Then shortly thereafter whenever anyone would order an Americano (Then all the rage) they would ask for it ""The Negroni Way""
The Family was quick to capitalize on the success of the cocktail, founding the Negroni distillery in 1919 in Treviso Italy where they produced a ready made version of the drink. "

He was a pharmacist who ran a drugstore from which he would prescribe medicine but would also make toddies and tonics as cure-alls as well as a drink with his famous Peychaud's Bitters (adapted from a family recipe) which is still served in Sazeracs and other cocktails to this day. The Original recipe called for Cognac or Brandy which changed to Rye in about 1865 due to a blight on wine grapes.The Phylloxera Aphid was wreaking havoc in France and completely stopped brandy and Cognac production. The cocktail also took a hit when Absinthe was banned in the United States in 1912, but the Sazerac hungry public was more than happy to drink anise flavored liquor in it's place.

Here's how it breaks down; When Whiskey Sours emerged in the 1860's or thereabouts, they were done over crushed ice, then around the 1890's the ice was extracted and the method of making a fizz with egg whites were added. That drink was called a Boston sour. A about the same time a little dash of Claret (Bordeaux style red wine) was added to the Boston Sour to create the New York Sour. Make sense? The Whiskey Sour was one of the very first cocktail to capture the people's imagination so completely that it spawned a whole bunch of variations. In it's day, it was considered an important part of American life."
