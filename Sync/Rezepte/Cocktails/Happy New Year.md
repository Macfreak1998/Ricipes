# History
The "Happy New Year" cocktail, as presented in this recipe, is a modern creation designed to evoke the festive spirit of New Year's celebrations. While there isn't a single, universally recognized "Happy New Year cocktail" with a distinct historical origin, the tradition of consuming alcoholic beverages, particularly champagne, is deeply intertwined with New Year's festivities.

The celebration of New Year's itself dates back thousands of years, with traditions of toasting and drinking to welcome the new year evolving over centuries. Champagne, in particular, gained popularity as a celebratory drink, becoming a symbol of luxury and sophistication for special occasions.

This "Happy New Year" cocktail combines Brandy, Ruby Port, Orange Juice, and Champagne. This blend creates a vibrant and celebratory drink, with the rich fruitiness of Ruby Port and orange juice, the warmth of brandy, and the effervescence of champagne. It is a perfect concoction to toast to new beginnings and festive gatherings, embodying the joy and optimism associated with ringing in the New Year.
