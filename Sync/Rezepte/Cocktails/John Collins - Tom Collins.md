# History
The "John Collins" and "Tom Collins" are classic cocktails with intertwined histories, both characterized as refreshing, long drinks served in a "Collins glass." While sharing a similar structure of spirit, lemon juice, sugar, and carbonated water, their origins and traditional spirit bases offer distinct narratives.

### John Collins Cocktail
The John Collins cocktail is believed to be the older of the two, with its origins tracing back to Limmer's Old House, a popular London hotel and coffee house between 1790 and 1817. A headwaiter named John Collins is credited with popularizing a gin punch that served as the precursor to the modern highball. Traditionally, the John Collins was made with London dry gin or Genever (a Dutch gin). In contemporary usage, a John Collins often refers to a version of the drink made with whiskey, typically bourbon, instead of gin.

### Tom Collins Cocktail
The exact origin of the Tom Collins is debated, with two main theories:
1.  **Evolution from John Collins:** Many believe the Tom Collins evolved directly from the John Collins. The name change is often attributed to the increasing popularity of "Old Tom Gin" in the 1870s, leading people to specifically request a "Tom Collins" when they wanted the drink made with this sweeter style of gin.
2.  **The Great Tom Collins Hoax of 1874:** Another popular theory links the cocktail's name to a widespread practical joke in New York in 1874. The hoax involved telling someone that a man named "Tom Collins" was slandering them at another bar. When the person went to confront this non-existent individual, bartenders, in on the joke, would serve them a refreshing gin drink. This prank significantly boosted the cocktail's popularity and cemented its name. The first recorded recipe for a Tom Collins appeared in Jerry Thomas's "The Bartender's Guide" in 1876.

### Key Differences and Relationship
Historically, the John Collins was made with Genever or London dry gin, while the Tom Collins specifically called for Old Tom Gin. Today, the most common distinction is that a Tom Collins uses gin (often London Dry), while a John Collins uses whiskey. Both cocktails belong to a broader "Collins family" of drinks, which are characterized by a base spirit, citrus, sweetener, and soda water, served in a tall glass.

This particular recipe, featuring Old Tom Gin, Lemon Juice, Simple Syrup, and Soda Water, is a classic rendition of the Tom Collins, highlighting the sweeter style of gin that gave the drink its name.
