# History
The Russian Bear cocktail is a creamy, sweet, and potent "Russian Dessert drink" typically made with vodka, dark crème de cacao, and cream or half-and-half. While its exact historical origin remains largely undocumented, it is often discussed in the context of other "Russian" themed cocktails, such as the White Russian and Black Russian.

The Black Russian, a precursor to the White Russian, was created in 1949 by Belgian bartender Gustave Tops at the Hotel Metropole in Brussels. The White Russian, which adds cream to the Black Russian, was first mentioned in print in 1965. The name "Russian Bear" likely stems from its primary ingredient, vodka, a spirit commonly associated with Russia, similar to how the Black Russian and White Russian cocktails are named.

It is possible the Russian Bear emerged as a variation within this family of creamy, vodka-based drinks, perhaps influenced by cocktails like the Alexander, which combines gin, crème de cacao, and cream. Despite its presence in cocktail recipes and mentions as a dessert drink, specific details regarding the invention date, the inventor, or the precise circumstances of the Russian Bear cocktail's creation are not readily available in historical records. This recipe, with vodka, crème de cacao white, heavy cream, and simple syrup, is a classic example of this indulgent cocktail.
