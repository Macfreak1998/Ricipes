# History
The "Don the Beachcomber Planters Punch" is a classic tiki cocktail with a rich history, though Donn Beach's version is an adaptation of an older drink.

The Planter's Punch originated in the West Indies, specifically Jamaica, likely between the late 18th and early 19th centuries. It was a refreshing concoction of rum, citrus, and simple syrup, initially prepared for workers to help them stay cool in the Caribbean heat. The name itself is derived from the fact that plantation owners, as sugarcane growers, had all the necessary ingredients readily available to make the punch. Early recipes for Planter's Punch were often presented in verse, with the first known printed recipe appearing in September 1878. A common rhyming formula for the drink is "One of sour, two of sweet, three of strong, and four of weak."

Donn Beach (born Ernest Raymond Beaumont Gantt), the pioneer of tiki culture, encountered the Planter's Punch in Jamaica. He was captivated by the drink and, true to his style of adapting recipes from his travels, created his own version for his famous Hollywood restaurant, Don the Beachcomber, around 1937. Donn Beach's approach involved creatively modifying each of the four core elements of the punch, using various fruit juice mixes for the "sour," infused sugar syrups for the "sweet," and blending multiple rums for the "strong" component. A signature technique he employed was the use of crushed ice and an electric mixer to flash blend his cocktails, which became a hallmark of his tiki drinks. His 1937 Planter's Punch recipe typically included aged rum, Jamaican rum, dark Jamaican rum, falernum, lime juice, simple syrup, grenadine, and Angostura bitters.

The "Planter's Punch" essentially refers to a category of rum-based punches, rather than a single fixed recipe, allowing for significant variation. The name signifies its historical connection to the Caribbean plantations and the individuals who cultivated the ingredients that made such a drink possible. Don the Beachcomber's version elevated it to a classic tiki cocktail, influencing countless other tropical drinks.
