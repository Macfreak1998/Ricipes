# History
The "Fog Cutter" is a potent tiki cocktail primarily credited to Victor "Trader Vic" Bergeron, first appearing in his 1946 *Book of Food and Drink* and later in his 1972 *Bartender's Guide*. It is considered a popular faux-Polynesian punch.

The cocktail is known for its high alcoholic content, combining rum, brandy, gin, sherry, orgeat syrup, lemon juice, and orange juice. Trader Vic himself famously warned about its strength, stating, "After two of these, you won't even see the stuff." It has been likened to the "Long Island Iced Tea of exotic drinks" due to its potency.

The name "Fog Cutter" is derived from a generic American term for a strong morning drink, similar to an "eye-opener," a phrase that dates back to at least the 1840s.

Historically, the Fog Cutter was served in bespoke ceramic mugs designed specifically for the drink, a practice that helped initiate the trend of unique glassware in tiki bars. While Trader Vic is widely credited with its invention and popularization, some sources suggest its origin might be disputed, with other claims pointing to establishments like Edna Fogcutter's or Don the Beachcomber's. Trader Vic later introduced a lighter, blended version known as the Samoan Fog Cutter, and numerous other variations have emerged over time.
