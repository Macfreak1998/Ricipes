# History
The Tom & Jerry cocktail, a traditional Christmas-time drink in the United States, is widely attributed to British journalist and writer Pierce Egan in the 1820s. Egan is believed to have created the cocktail as a promotional strategy for his 1821 book, "Life in London, or The Day and Night Scenes of Jerry Hawthorn Esq. and his Elegant Friend Corinthian Tom," and the subsequent stage play based on it. He introduced a variation of eggnog by adding brandy and naming it "Tom and Jerry," which contributed to its popularity.

While Egan is generally recognized as the originator, Jerry Thomas, a renowned New York bartender, also claimed to have invented the drink. Thomas included a similar egg-based cocktail recipe in his 1862 book, "How to Mix Drinks." However, most historians credit Egan as the true creator.

The Tom & Jerry cocktail is a warm variant of eggnog, typically prepared with brandy and rum. The preparation involves separating eggs, beating the whites until stiff, and mixing the yolks with powdered sugar. This mixture is then combined with brandy and rum, folded with egg white, and topped with hot milk and additional egg white, often garnished with nutmeg. This recipe, with a whole egg, simple syrup, white rum, and hot heavy cream, is a classic example of this festive and indulgent cocktail.
