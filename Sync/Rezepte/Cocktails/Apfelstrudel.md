# History
The Apfelstrudel shot is a modern invention, created to taste like the famous Austrian dessert, the Apfelstrudel. While the pastry has a long history, with the oldest known recipe dating back to 1697, the shot is a recent creation.

The shot typically combines ingredients like apple juice, rum, and cinnamon to mimic the flavors of the dessert. It's a popular way to enjoy the taste of Apfelstrudel in a liquid, alcoholic form.
