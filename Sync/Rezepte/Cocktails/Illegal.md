# History
The "Illegal cocktail" is a modern creation that has gained popularity as a "New era drink" on the 2020 IBA Official Cocktail List.

Its name is directly linked to the "Ilegal Mezcal" brand, a key ingredient in the drink. The mezcal brand itself has a storied past, with its founder, John Rexer, initially smuggling mezcal from Oaxaca to Antigua, Guatemala, to supply his bar, Café No Sé. Rexer also noted that the name "Ilegal" resonated with the experiences of people from Oaxaca who lived "illegally" in the United States due to economic hardship. Beyond its literal connection to the mezcal, the cocktail's name also evokes a sense of forbidden indulgence, drawing inspiration from the Prohibition era.

The "Illegal cocktail" is characterized by its bold and smoky flavor profile, primarily due to the mezcal. This particular recipe includes Mezcal, Jamaican Overproof White Rum, Velvet Falernum, Maraschino Liqueur, Lime Juice, Simple Syrup, and Egg White. This combination creates a complex and intriguing drink, balancing the smoky notes of mezcal with the tropical fruitiness of rum and falernum, the sweetness of maraschino and simple syrup, and the tartness of lime, all brought together with the silky texture of egg white.
