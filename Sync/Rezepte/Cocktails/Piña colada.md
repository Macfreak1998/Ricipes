# History
The Piña Colada, a world-renowned tropical cocktail, is widely believed to have been created in Puerto Rico. The most commonly cited origin story attributes its invention to Ramón "Monchito" Marrero, a bartender at the Caribe Hilton Hotel in San Juan, Puerto Rico, on August 15, 1954. He was tasked with creating a signature drink that captured the essence of the island.

Marrero's creation was a blend of rum, pineapple juice, and cream of coconut. The name "Piña Colada" translates from Spanish as "strained pineapple," referring to the fresh pineapple juice used in its preparation. The drink quickly gained popularity and was declared the national drink of Puerto Rico in 1978.

While there are other claims to its invention, Marrero's story is the most widely accepted. The Piña Colada became a global sensation, symbolizing tropical getaways and relaxation, and its popularity was further boosted by Rupert Holmes' 1979 song "Escape" (often referred to as the "Piña Colada song").
