# History
The "Jade cocktail" is a vibrant, often green-hued drink named after the gemstone jade. Its history is somewhat unclear, with some believing it emerged in the early 2000s as bartenders experimented with new recipes. However, a specific "Jade Cocktail" was also one of the first creations by Giuliano Morandin, Bar Manager at The Dorchester, dating back to the early 1980s.

There are several variations of the Jade cocktail. This particular recipe, featuring Lime Juice, Sugar, Triple Sec, Crème de Menthe Green, and White Rum, is a common rendition. It combines the tropical notes of white rum with the refreshing mint of crème de menthe, balanced by the tartness of lime and the sweetness of sugar and triple sec. The green color is primarily imparted by the Crème de Menthe, giving it its characteristic "jade" appearance. This cocktail offers a refreshing and visually appealing experience.
