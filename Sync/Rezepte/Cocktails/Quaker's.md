# History
The Quaker's Cocktail is a relatively modern alcoholic beverage, with its first known publication dating back to 1923. It was introduced by Harry McElhone in his book "Harry of Giro's ABC of Mixing Cocktails." McElhone later suggested in his 1927 work, "Barflies and Cocktails," that the drink might have been named after the Quakers due to an accompanying illustration.

This cocktail falls under the "sour" category, which is defined by its combination of a spirit, citrus juice, and a sweetener. The initial recipe for the Quaker's Cocktail called for equal parts rye whiskey and brandy, balanced with either lime or lemon juice and a teaspoon of raspberry syrup.

Over time, the recipe for the Quaker's Cocktail evolved, with various bartenders creating their own interpretations. This recipe, with brandy, white rum, lemon juice, simple syrup, and cranberry syrup, is a variation that reflects the adaptability of this classic sour. It is important to differentiate the Quaker's Cocktail from the much older Philadelphia Fish House Punch, which has a distinct history despite some Quaker associations.
