# History
The "Zico" cocktail, with its tropical ingredients, appears to be a modern creation, and its exact historical origin is not clearly documented. The "Zico" brand, primarily known for its coconut water, was founded in 2004, so there is no direct connection to that brand in 1986.

While there is a recipe for a "Zico Cocktail" that includes similar ingredients (white rum, papaya juice, coconut cream, and lime juice), its historical origin, particularly in 1986, is not specified in widely available cocktail literature. The "1986" in the categories might indicate a specific publication or popularization date for this particular recipe, rather than its initial creation.

This recipe, with lime juice, coconut cream, papaya juice, white rum, and cachaça, offers a vibrant and exotic flavor profile. It's a refreshing tropical drink that likely emerged from the creativity of bartenders experimenting with South American-inspired ingredients and flavors. The name "Zico" could be a reference to the famous Brazilian footballer, adding a playful and cultural touch to the cocktail.
