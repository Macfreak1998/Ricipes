# History
The "Bamboo" cocktail is a classic, low-ABV drink primarily composed of sherry, vermouth, and bitters, notable for its absence of a base spirit.

The earliest known reference to the Bamboo cocktail dates back to 1886, with newspaper articles from that year crediting an unknown Englishman with its creation. William T. "Cocktail Bill" Boothby, in his 1908 book "The World's Drinks And How To Mix Them," attributed the drink to Louis Eppinger, a German bartender at the Grand Hotel in Yokohama, Japaccordingly. While it was long believed he created the drink there, the cocktail predates his arrival, suggesting he may have developed it earlier in San Francisco or Portland, Oregon. By 1900, the Bamboo cocktail had become widely popular, appearing on cocktail menus and even being sold as a bottled beverage.

The exact meaning behind the name "Bamboo" is debated, as the drink contains no actual bamboo. One theory suggests it was inspired by Bob Cole's 1902 song "Under the Bamboo Tree," though the cocktail predates the song. Another perspective links the name to the bamboo plant's symbolism of grace and flexibility in Japanese culture, particularly in attributions to a bartender named N. A. "Adam" Akkar in Yokohama. An 1886 newspaper article humorously posited that the name came from the feeling of "raising Cain" after imbibing. The cocktail is sometimes described as a "fluid Zen kōan," reflecting its austere yet intricate nature and its adaptability.
