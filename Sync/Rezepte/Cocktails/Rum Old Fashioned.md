# History
The Rum Old Fashioned is a variation of the classic Old Fashioned cocktail, which has a history dating back to the early 1800s. Originally known as a "whiskey cocktail" or "bittered sling," the Old Fashioned's foundational recipe included spirits, sugar, water, and bitters. The term "Old Fashioned" gained popularity in the 1880s as drinkers began requesting simpler, traditional drinks.

The Rum Old Fashioned specifically replaces whiskey with rum in this classic formula. While its precise origins are not definitively documented, it is widely believed to have emerged from the Caribbean or Latin America, regions where rum is a prevalent spirit.

This recipe, with white rum, a sugar cube, Angostura bitters, and soda water, embodies the classic Old Fashioned structure but with the distinct flavor profile of rum. The addition of lemon and orange wedges, muddled with the sugar and bitters, is a common variation that adds a fresh citrus note to the drink.
