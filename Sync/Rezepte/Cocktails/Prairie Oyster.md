# History
The Prairie Oyster is a traditional beverage often touted as a hangover remedy, believed to have originated in New England in the late 1800s. While its exact creator remains unknown, historians place its inception around the 1890s.

The drink's name is thought to derive from its resemblance in texture and consumption method to an actual oyster, despite containing no seafood. An early account from 1859 links the recipe to the prairies and Rocky Mountains of western North America.

The basic Prairie Oyster typically consists of a raw egg yolk (often unbroken), Worcestershire sauce, vinegar (or hot sauce), salt, and black pepper. Some variations include tomato juice, reminiscent of a Bloody Mary, and occasionally spirits like brandy, vodka, or gin. It gained a reputation as a classic hangover cure, a belief that has persisted despite no scientific evidence supporting its effectiveness. The Prairie Oyster has also made its way into popular culture, notably appearing in P.G. Wodehouse's Jeeves novels.
