# History
The "John Morris" cocktail, as presented in this recipe, is a modern and complex drink that does not have a widely documented historical origin or a formal place in classic mixology. The name "John Morris" is not associated with a recognized historical cocktail and is likely a unique or personal name for this specific concoction.

This cocktail features a potent blend of multiple spirits, including Gin, White Rum, Vodka, Blanco Tequila, and Cointreau, combined with Lime Juice, Simple Syrup, Coconut Syrup, and topped with Soda Water. This combination creates a vibrant, multi-layered, and refreshing drink. The diverse spirits contribute a wide range of botanical, rum, agave, and orange liqueur notes, balanced by the tartness of lime and the sweetness of simple and coconut syrups, all lengthened with soda water. It represents a creative and bold approach to cocktail creation, appealing to those who enjoy strong and unconventional flavor profiles with a tropical twist.
