# History
The Porto Flip cocktail has a rich history, first appearing in print in Jerry Thomas's influential 1862 publication, "The Bartender's Guide: How to Mix Drinks; A Bon Vivant's Companion." Interestingly, it was initially listed as the "Coffee Cocktail," a name derived from its appearance rather than its ingredients.

The "flip" category of cocktails, to which the Porto Flip belongs, has roots dating back to the 1600s. These early flips were often heated concoctions of beer, rum, and sugar. By the mid-1800s, the style evolved to include whole eggs, sweeteners, and spirits, shaken to create a creamy texture.

The Porto Flip specifically combines brandy, port wine, and egg yolk. The inclusion of port, a fortified wine popular in Victorian society, gave the drink a luxurious European twist. Despite changing cocktail trends, the Porto Flip has maintained its appeal and has seen a resurgence in interest as classic cocktails have been revived. This recipe, with brandy, red port wine, and egg white, is a classic example of this enduring cocktail.
