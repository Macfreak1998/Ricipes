# History
The "Mexican Coffee" cocktail, as it became known in many restaurants and cocktail books, was reportedly invented in 1972 by Victor Bergeron, the founder of the Trader Vic's chain. Bergeron created this drink for his Mexican-themed restaurant, Señor Pico, located in Ghirardelli Square in the Bay Area. His inspiration came from the popular Irish Coffee served at the nearby Buena Vista Cafe. By the 1980s, this version of Mexican Coffee was common in Mexican restaurants, and by the 1990s, it began appearing in cocktail books. While people had mixed coffee and alcohol for a long time, Bergeron's restaurant was credited with giving this specific recipe its name and popularizing it.

This cocktail represents an American adaptation and popularization of a coffee-and-spirit combination, drawing inspiration from other well-known coffee cocktails. It became a staple in Mexican-themed dining, offering a distinct flavor profile often including coffee liqueur, tequila, and cream.

This particular recipe features Tequila Blanco, Coffee Liqueur, brown Simple Syrup, hot Espresso, and Heavy Cream. It combines the rich flavors of tequila and coffee liqueur with the strong notes of espresso, sweetened by brown simple syrup and topped with heavy cream. It offers a comforting and indulgent experience, reminiscent of a dessert drink, and is a testament to the enduring appeal of coffee and spirits in Mexican-inspired beverages.
