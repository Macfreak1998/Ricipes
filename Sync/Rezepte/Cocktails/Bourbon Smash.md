# History
The Bourbon Smash is a modern fall-themed cocktail created by German Instagram bartender @somersby_de as part of their autumn drinks series. This creative variation on the classic Smash formula combines bourbon with apple elements (apple sauce and apple cider), creating a perfect autumn cocktail.

The cocktail represents the modern trend of incorporating seasonal ingredients and commercial ciders into craft cocktail recipes. The use of Apfelmus (German for apple sauce) adds texture and natural apple sweetness, while Somersby Apple Cider tops the drink with effervescence and additional apple character.

The Smash cocktail family dates back to the mid-1800s, traditionally consisting of spirit, sugar, mint, and crushed ice. This bourbon version replaces mint with autumn spices (cinnamon) and incorporates apple flavors, making it perfectly suited for fall drinking.

The combination of bourbon's vanilla and oak notes with apple's crisp sweetness and the warming quality of cinnamon or maple creates a comforting, seasonal drink that bridges the gap between summer refreshment and winter warmth.
