# History
The Last Flight is a modern craft cocktail created by Italian bartender Giulio Cercato (@gin_with_me on Instagram). The drink is a direct variation of the Paper Plane, one of the most successful modern classic cocktails created by Sam Ross in 2007.

The creator's personal connection to this drink is evident in his introduction: "I'm really excited to see which of you I'll meet there! On Friday, our flight leaves from Zurich to Berlin, and this drink spontaneously came to mind: The Last Flight. This is what you get, when you cross the Last Word with a Paper Plane. I hope it won't be our last flight...🥲"

**The Paper Plane:**

Created by Sam Ross at The Violet Hour in Chicago, the Paper Plane is an equal-parts cocktail:
- Bourbon
- Aperol
- Amaro Nonino
- Lemon juice

It became one of the 2000s' most influential cocktails, appearing on bar menus worldwide and inspiring countless variations.

**The Last Word Connection:**

The Last Flight's name directly references two classic cocktails:
1. **Last Word** (gin, Green Chartreuse, maraschino, lime) - A Prohibition-era cocktail from Detroit
2. **Paper Plane** - The modern classic it's based on

By substituting Green Chartreuse for Amaro Nonino, Cercato creates a bridge between these two influential drinks, hence "what you get when you cross the Last Word with a Paper Plane."

**Flavor Transformation:**

The substitution of Green Chartreuse for Amaro Nonino significantly changes the drink's character:

- **Green Chartreuse** (55% ABV): Intensely herbal, slightly medicinal, with 130 botanicals. Sweet but potent.
- **Amaro Nonino** (35% ABV): Lighter, more orange-forward, less herbal intensity.

The higher proof and more aggressive herbal character of Chartreuse creates a more intense, complex drink than the Paper Plane. It's less approachable but more interesting for adventurous drinkers.

**Equal Parts Philosophy:**

Like both the Last Word and Paper Plane, this uses the equal-parts formula (0.75 oz each), which creates perfect balance when the ingredients are chosen correctly. This approach has become a signature of modern craft cocktails, making complex drinks that are both easy to remember and reliably balanced.

The Last Flight demonstrates how understanding classic cocktail templates allows bartenders to create new drinks by thoughtful ingredient substitutions, maintaining balance while achieving distinctly different flavor profiles.
