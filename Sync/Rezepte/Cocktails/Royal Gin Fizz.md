# History
The Royal Gin Fizz is a member of the "Fizz" cocktail family, characterized by its refreshing and bubbly nature. The broader Gin Fizz category has a long history, dating back to around 1750, believed to have originated as a therapeutic drink for sailors, combining gin and lemon to combat scurvy. Over time, sugar and soda water were added, transforming it into the cocktail we recognize today.

Historically, a "Royal Fizz" typically distinguished itself from a standard Gin Fizz by the inclusion of a whole egg in its preparation. This is in contrast to other variations like the Silver Fizz, which uses only egg white, and the Golden Fizz, which incorporates only egg yolk. The whole egg contributes to a richer, creamier texture and a more substantial foam.

More contemporary interpretations of the "Royal Gin Fizz" sometimes deviate from the traditional whole-egg inclusion, opting instead to use sparkling wine like prosecco or champagne in place of soda water. This recipe, with gin, lemon juice, simple syrup, a whole egg, and Champagne, aligns with this more elaborate and celebratory interpretation of the Royal Gin Fizz.
