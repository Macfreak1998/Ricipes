# History
The "La Floridita Daiquiri" is a renowned cocktail with a rich history deeply rooted in Havana, Cuba, specifically at the historic El Floridita bar, known as "la cuna del daiquiri" (the cradle of the daiquiri).

El Floridita first opened in 1817 under the name "La Piña de Plata" (The Silver Pineapple) and was later affectionately called "El Floridita" by locals. A pivotal figure in its history was Constantino Ribalaigua Vert, known as "Constante," who began working as a bartender in 1914 and later became the owner in 1918. Constante is widely credited with inventing the frozen daiquiri in the early 1930s, solidifying El Floridita's reputation.

The "La Floridita Daiquiri" gained significant international recognition due to its association with the American writer Ernest Hemingway. Hemingway was a frequent patron of El Floridita and favored a specific variation of the daiquiri with less sugar and more rum, which became famously known as the "Papa Doble" or "Hemingway Daiquiri." This recipe evolved to include grapefruit juice and maraschino liqueur.

This particular recipe, featuring Lime Juice, Powdered Sugar or Simple Syrup, Maraschino Liqueur, and White Rum, is a classic rendition of the "La Floridita Daiquiri," embodying the refined and often fruit-enhanced style perfected at El Floridita.
