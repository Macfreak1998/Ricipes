# History
The Sarti Spritz is a modern cocktail that gained significant popularity in the summer of 2023, particularly in Finland and across social media platforms. This vibrant, pink beverage quickly became a favorite, showcasing a growing interest in innovative, fruit-forward cocktails.

The cocktail's foundation is Sarti Rosa, a striking pink aperitivo produced by Casa Luigi Sarti & Figli, an Italian manufacturer based in Bologna. Sarti Rosa was first crafted in 1885 and later became part of the Campari Group in 1995. It is characterized by a unique blend of flavors, including blood oranges, mango, and passionfruit, giving it a distinctive sweet and fruity taste.

The rise of the Sarti Spritz is closely linked to a social media boom, where its appealing pink hue and refreshing appearance, often garnished with fruit slices, trended widely. While similar to the classic Aperol Spritz in its spritz-style preparation (typically involving Prosecco, Sarti Rosa, and soda water), the Sarti Spritz offers a distinct flavor profile. Unlike Aperol, which has a more bitter and herbal taste, Sarti Spritz is notably sweeter and fruitier, appealing to those who prefer a less bitter aperitif. This recipe, with Prosecco, Sarti, and soda water, is a classic example of this popular modern spritz.
