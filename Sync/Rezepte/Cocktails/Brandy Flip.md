# History
The "Brandy Flip" cocktail has a rich history, with its origins tracing back to the late 17th century. The term "flip" itself first appeared in 1695, describing a drink made from ale, sugar, and spices, which was heated with a red-hot iron poker to make it froth or "flip."

Over time, the drink evolved significantly. Eggs were eventually added to the mixture, the amount of sugar increased, and the beer component was removed. The practice of heating with a hot poker was replaced by the use of a cocktail shaker, and the drink transitioned from being served hot to cold.

The Brandy Flip is considered one of the oldest variations of the flip, potentially dating back to the American colonial period. Brandy became a favored spirit for this cocktail due to its smooth and complex flavor profile. The first documented recipe for a flip, including a "Cold Brandy Flip," was published in Jerry Thomas's influential 1862 *Bar-Tender's Guide*.

A Brandy Flip is characterized by its creamy, velvety texture, achieved by vigorously shaking a whole egg (yolk and white), brandy, and sugar, often garnished with grated nutmeg. The name "Flip" also refers to the vigorous shaking required to create its signature frothy top. Historically, flips were popular in both English and American taverns until the 19th century, often referred to as a "sailor's drink." By the 19th century, the Brandy Flip had become a symbol of sophistication.
