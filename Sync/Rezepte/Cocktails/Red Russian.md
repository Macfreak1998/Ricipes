# History
The Red Russian cocktail is generally considered a vibrant, fruity variation of the classic White Russian cocktail. While the White Russian (vodka, coffee liqueur, and cream) gained significant fame, the Red Russian emerged as a simpler, often fruit-based, alternative.

One common interpretation, which aligns with this recipe, defines the Red Russian as a concoction of vodka and a cherry liqueur, such as Cherry Heering. This combination creates a drink with a distinct red hue and a sweet, fruity flavor profile.

The exact origins of this specific "Red Russian" are unclear, but it is understood to be a "riff" on the more popular coffee-based Black and White Russian drinks. It likely gained popularity as bartenders experimented with different liqueurs and fruit flavors to create new variations of the "Russian" cocktail family. This version offers a straightforward, spirit-forward drink with a pleasant cherry sweetness.
