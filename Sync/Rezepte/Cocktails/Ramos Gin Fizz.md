# History
The Ramos Gin Fizz, originally known as "The New Orleans Fizz," was created in 1888 by Henry Charles Ramos at the Imperial Cabinet Saloon in New Orleans. Ramos, also known as Carl, was not a drinker himself but developed this iconic cocktail.

The drink quickly gained immense popularity due to its unique frothy texture, resembling a thick whipped cream, achieved through vigorous and extended shaking. The original recipe called for shaking the cocktail for an impressive 12 minutes, a significant undertaking for bartenders. The demand for the Ramos Gin Fizz was so high that Ramos's saloon reportedly employed over 20, and at one point even 35, "shaker boys" to keep up with orders.

After Prohibition, the cocktail experienced a resurgence in popularity, notably championed by Louisiana Governor Huey P. Long. The Ramos Gin Fizz remains a beloved and challenging classic, celebrated for its unique texture and refreshing taste. This recipe, with gin, lemon and lime juices, simple syrup, heavy cream, egg white, and orange flower water, adheres to the traditional preparation of this labor-intensive but rewarding cocktail.
