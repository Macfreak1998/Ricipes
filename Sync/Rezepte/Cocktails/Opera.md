# History
The "Opera cocktail" is a classic drink with a history dating back to the early 20th century, featuring two primary versions that have evolved over time. Its name likely stems from a broader tradition of cocktails inspired by opera.

The original Opera cocktail first appeared in Jacques Straub's 1914 book, "Drinks." This initial rendition was a small drink consisting of half a jigger each of dry gin and Dubonnet, sweetened with two barspoons of crème de mandarine.

A later, and perhaps more widely known, version was published by Harry Craddock in "The Savoy Cocktail Book" in 1930. Craddock's recipe maintained the gin and Dubonnet but notably substituted Maraschino liqueur for the crème de mandarine. This version typically called for four parts gin to one part each of Maraschino and Dubonnet. Maraschino liqueur, made from Marasca cherries, was a popular ingredient during that era.

While the specific "meaning" behind the Opera cocktail's name isn't explicitly detailed as a direct inspiration from a particular opera or event, it fits into a category of cocktails named after operas or opera singers. This practice often involved inventing drinks to celebrate specific opera runs or to match a theme derived from an opera. Therefore, the Opera cocktail likely received its name as a nod to the cultural significance and popularity of opera during its creation period.

This particular recipe features Sweet Vermouth, Gin, and Maraschino Liqueur, aligning with Craddock's version from "The Savoy Cocktail Book," creating a sophisticated and aromatic drink.
