# History
The "Fino Martini" is a sophisticated variation of the classic Martini cocktail, where Fino Sherry is used in place of dry vermouth. This substitution imparts a distinct salinity, acidity, and nuttiness to the drink, differentiating it from the herbal and bitter notes of traditional vermouth. While it's likely that such a drink was made before, a notable appearance of the Fino Martini recipe is in Stan Jones' *Complete Barguide* from 1977.

The history of the **Martini cocktail** is somewhat shrouded in mystery, with several theories regarding its origin. The most widely accepted theory suggests the Martini evolved from the Martinez cocktail, which itself evolved from the Manhattaccordingly. The Martinez first appeared in O.H. Byron's 1884 *The Modern Bartender*, and Harry Johnson's 1888 *Bartender Manual* included an early recipe for a "Martini." The move towards a "dry" Martini began to appear in cocktail books around 1903.

**Fino Sherry** is the driest and palest of the traditional varieties of sherry, a fortified wine produced in Andalusia, Spain. Its defining characteristic is its biological aging under a layer of "flor" yeast, which protects the wine from oxidation and imparts unique flavors, including a salty note. The discovery of biological aging, which led to Fino, occurred in Sanlúcar de Barrameda in the late 18th to early 19th century. The name "fino" itself is Spanish for "fine" or "refined," a fitting description for its delicate profile.

The "Fino Martini" combines the historical elegance of the Martini with the unique characteristics of Fino Sherry, creating a crisp, dry, and subtly complex aperitif.
