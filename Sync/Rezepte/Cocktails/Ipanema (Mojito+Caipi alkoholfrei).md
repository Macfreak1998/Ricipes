# History
The Ipanema is a popular non-alcoholic cocktail that originated in Brazil. It is essentially a non-alcoholic version of the Caipirinha, Brazil's national cocktail. The drink is named after the world-famous Ipanema beach in Rio de Janeiro, and it is meant to evoke the feeling of a sunny day on the beach.

The Ipanema is a simple and refreshing mix of muddled lime and sugar, topped with ginger ale. It is a popular drink in Brazil and around the world, and it is a great way to enjoy the taste of a Caipirinha without the alcohol. The file name also suggests a similarity to a non-alcoholic Mojito, as both drinks share the common ingredients of lime and sugar, with a sparkling beverage on top.
