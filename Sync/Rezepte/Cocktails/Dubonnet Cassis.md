# History
The "Dubonnet Cassis" refers to a drink combining Dubonnet, a French aromatized wine, with Crème de Cassis, a sweet, dark red liqueur made from blackcurrants. While this combination is likely a straightforward mix rather than a historically distinct cocktail with its own separate origin story, its components have rich histories.

**Dubonnet:**
Dubonnet was first created in 1846 by Parisian chemist and wine merchant Joseph Dubonnet. The French government initiated a competition to find a way to make quinine, a bitter anti-malarial drug, more palatable for French Foreign Legionnaires stationed in North Africa. Dubonnet's solution was to blend quinine with fortified wine, herbs, and spices, creating a unique and more enjoyable beverage. This original recipe was initially called "quinquina Dubonnet" and proved highly popular among soldiers. Dubonnet gained significant popularity in Paris during the "belle époque" and is famously known as a favorite drink of the British Royal Family, particularly Queen Elizabeth II and the Queen Mother.

**Crème de Cassis:**
Crème de Cassis is a blackcurrant liqueur that originated in Burgundy, France. It is known for its sweet, fruity flavor and deep red color. It is commonly used in cocktails, most notably in the Kir (Crème de Cassis and white wine) and Kir Royale (Crème de Cassis and champagne).

When combined, "Dubonnet Cassis" creates a pleasant aperitif where the fruity sweetness of the Crème de Cassis complements the herbal and fortified wine notes of Dubonnet, often lengthened with soda water for a refreshing experience.
