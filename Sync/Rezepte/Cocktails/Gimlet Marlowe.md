Original version Marlowe's Gin Gimlet

# History
The "Gimlet Marlowe" refers to the classic Gimlet cocktail as famously depicted and popularized in Raymond Chandler's 1953 novel, "The Long Goodbye." In the novel, Chandler's iconic hardboiled detective protagonist, Philip Marlowe, articulates a purist's definition of the drink, stating, "A real gimlet is half gin and half Rose's Lime Juice and nothing else." This literary reference significantly boosted the Gimlet's cultural status and established a specific, often cited, recipe for the cocktail.

The Gimlet cocktail itself has a rich history rooted in the 19th century aboard ships of the British Royal Navy. It originated as a practical measure to combat scurvy, a disease caused by vitamin C deficiency. To make the highly acidic lime juice more palatable, naval officers began mixing it with their gin rations. This utilitarian practice laid the foundation for the Gimlet. In 1867, Lauchlan Rose patented a method to preserve citrus juice with sugar, leading to the creation of Rose's Lime Juice Cordial, which subsequently became the traditional ingredient for Gimlets.

The first recorded recipe for the Gimlet, specifying equal parts gin and Rose's Lime Juice Cordial, is believed to have appeared in Harry McElhone's "Harry's ABC of Mixing Cocktails" in 1923. The renowned "Savoy Cocktail Book" of 1930 also featured a recipe with a half gin, half Rose's cordial ratio.

The name "Gimlet" has two primary theories regarding its origin:
*   **Sir Thomas Gimlette:** One theory suggests the drink was named after Rear-Admiral Sir Thomas Gimlette (1857-1943), a Royal Navy surgeon, who encouraged officers to mix gin with lime juice.
*   **Piercing Tool:** The more widely accepted theory links the cocktail's name to a "gimlet," a small, screw-tipped tool used for boring holes, reflecting the drink's "lively, piercing style."

This particular recipe, labeled "Marlowe's Gin Gimlet," adheres to the classic gin and lime juice combination, embodying the simplicity and sharp character celebrated in Chandler's novel.
