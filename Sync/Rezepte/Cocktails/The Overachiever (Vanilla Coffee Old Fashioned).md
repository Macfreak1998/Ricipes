# History
"The Overachiever (Vanilla Coffee Old Fashioned)" is a modern variation of the classic Old Fashioned cocktail, which itself boasts a rich history dating back to the early 19th century. The Old Fashioned is considered one of the oldest cocktails, with its definition first appearing in print in 1806.

As the 19th century progressed, bartenders began to experiment with more complex concoctions. This led some drinkers to request the drink "the old-fashioned way," desiring the simpler, original recipe, which ultimately gave the cocktail its enduring name.

The concept of incorporating coffee and vanilla into an Old Fashioned is a more recent innovation, reflecting a broader trend in mixology to introduce new flavor profiles to classic drinks. This particular "Overachiever" variation was created by Elliott Clark, known as the "Apartment Bartender." It takes the foundational elements of the Old Fashioned—spirit, sweetener, and bitters—and introduces the contemporary flavors of vanilla and coffee, creating a unique and "overachieving" flavor profile. It's an example of how modern mixologists continue to innovate upon established classics.
