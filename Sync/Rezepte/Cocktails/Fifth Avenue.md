# History
The "Fifth Avenue cocktail" is a classic drink that dates back to the early 20th century, notably appearing in "The Savoy Cocktail Book," first published in 1930. Its presence in such a seminal cocktail guide from the era suggests it was a recognized and popular drink of the time.

The name "Fifth Avenue cocktail" is said to capture the "essence of the glitz and glamour of New York City's famous shopping district." This suggests the drink was intended to evoke a sense of sophistication, luxury, and elegance associated with Fifth Avenue.

The classic "Fifth Avenue cocktail" is typically made with Apricot Brandy (or Apricot Liqueur), Crème de Cacao (dark or white), and Heavy Cream (or half and half). This combination results in a blend of fruity and creamy flavors. It can be served as a mixed cocktail or as a layered "pousse-café" style drink, where the ingredients are carefully poured to create distinct layers. The alcohol content is moderate, making it a milder option compared to stronger cocktails.
