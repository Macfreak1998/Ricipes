# History

The Vesper cocktail has a rich history, deeply intertwined with the world of James Bond. It was first introduced in Ian Fleming's debut novel, *Casino Royale*, published in 1953. In the book, James Bond himself creates the drink, specifying its unique blend: "Three measures of Gordon's, one of vodka, half a measure of Kina Lillet. Shake it very well until it's ice-cold, then add a large thin slice of lemon peel." Bond later names this potent concoction after the captivating double agent, Vesper Lynd, with whom he develops a profound connection.



While the cocktail is fictionalized as Bond's invention, its origins are rooted in Ian Fleming's own life. Fleming, known for his adventurous spirit and appreciation for fine drinks, is believed to have conceived the Vesper. Some accounts suggest it was created at London's Dukes Bar, a place Fleming frequented. However, a more widely accepted theory points to Fleming's friend, Ivar Bryce, who Fleming credited with mixing the first Vesper.



The original Vesper recipe notably includes Kina Lillet, a French aperitif wine characterized by its bitter quinine notes. This ingredient, however, was discontinued in 1986. Modern versions of Lillet, such as Lillet Blanc, have a significantly reduced quinine content, making it challenging to replicate the authentic taste of the original Vesper. This recipe, with gin, vodka, and Lillet Blanc, is a classic example of this iconic cocktail.
