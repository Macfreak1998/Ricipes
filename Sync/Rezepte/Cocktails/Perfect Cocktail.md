# History
The "Perfect Cocktail" is a classic drink whose name signifies a specific mixing convention rather than an assessment of its quality. A "Perfect" cocktail is defined by the use of equal parts both sweet vermouth and dry vermouth in its recipe.

The concept of a "Perfect" cocktail emerged as a variation of classic drinks like the Manhattan, which typically uses only sweet vermouth. The addition of dry vermouth alongside sweet vermouth creates a more balanced and nuanced flavor profile, often resulting in a cocktail that is less sweet and drier than its traditional counterpart, with subtle herbal and floral notes.

This particular recipe features Dry Vermouth, Sweet Vermouth, and Gin. It is essentially a "Perfect Martini" or a "Perfect Gin Cocktail," showcasing the balanced vermouth blend with gin as the base spirit. The Martini cocktail itself has a rich and somewhat mysterious history, with several theories pointing to its inception in the mid-19th century, evolving from drinks like the Martinez. The "Perfect Cocktail" represents a sophisticated approach to classic mixology, offering a refined and balanced drinking experience.
