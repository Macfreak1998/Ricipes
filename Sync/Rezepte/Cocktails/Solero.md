# History
The Solero cocktail was created around 2003 by Ross Simon while he was bartending at the LAB bar in Soho, London, England. Simon drew inspiration for the creamy, passion fruit-flavored drink from his favorite childhood treat, the Solero ice cream bar, which combines vanilla ice cream with passion fruit sorbet.

The cocktail typically features ingredients such as passion fruit vodka, vanilla schnapps or liqueur, passion fruit drink, puree, or syrup, Passoã liqueur, and cream or half and half. Ross Simon later brought the Solero cocktail to his own establishment, Bitter & Twisted Cocktail Parlour in Phoenix, where it has remained a popular item since the bar opened in 2014.

This recipe, with vodka, Licor 43, lemon juice, simple syrup, and passion fruit juice, is a variation that captures the essence of the original Solero cocktail, offering a vibrant and fruity flavor profile reminiscent of the ice cream that inspired it. The vigorous shaking to create foam further enhances the creamy texture associated with the Solero ice cream.
