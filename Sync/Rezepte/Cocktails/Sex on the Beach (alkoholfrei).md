# History
The "Sex on the Beach" cocktail is widely believed to have originated in 1987 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, during Spring Break. According to this popular account, a bartender named Ted Pizio at a bar called Confetti created the drink as part of a competition to sell the most peach schnapps. When asked for a name, he reportedly thought of the two main reasons tourists came to the area: "sex" and "the beach," thus naming the cocktail "Sex on the Beach."

The original alcoholic recipe is said to have included vodka, peach liqueur, orange juice, and cranberry juice. The cocktail quickly gained popularity due to its provocative name and sweet, refreshing taste, becoming an icon of the 1980s and 1990s.

This recipe is a non-alcoholic adaptation of the popular "Sex on the Beach" cocktail. It captures the fruity and refreshing essence of the original by combining peach syrup, grenadine, almond syrup, lemon juice, and orange juice, offering a delicious and vibrant drink suitable for all ages.
