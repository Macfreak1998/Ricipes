# History
The "Maurice Chevalier cocktail" is a classic and sophisticated drink that originated in France. It is named after the renowned French actor and singer, Maurice Chevalier, a prominent figure in early 20th-century French cinema, celebrated for his charm and charisma. The cocktail is intended to honor his suave personality through its elegant combination of ingredients.

The cocktail is described as a strong and sophisticated drink, known for its bold flavors and smooth finish. While there can be variations, common ingredients for the Maurice Chevalier cocktail include gin, dry vermouth (often Noilly Prat French vermouth), and orange bitters. Some recipes also incorporate rosso vermouth (sweet vermouth) and orange juice.

This particular recipe features Sweet Vermouth, Noilly Prat Dry Vermouth, Orange Bitters, Orange Juice, and Gin. This blend creates a complex and balanced drink, combining the botanical notes of gin with the herbal and slightly sweet profiles of both sweet and dry vermouths, brightened by orange juice and enhanced by orange bitters. It is a sophisticated and flavorful tribute to its namesake.
