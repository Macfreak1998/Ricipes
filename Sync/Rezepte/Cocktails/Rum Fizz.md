# History
The "Fizz" cocktail family, which includes rum-based variations, gained widespread popularity in America between 1900 and the 1940s. These drinks are characterized by an acidic juice, such as lemon or lime, and carbonated water, often with gin or rum as the alcoholic base.

Historically, fizz cocktails were often consumed as breakfast drinks or hangover cures due to their effervescent and refreshing qualities. The concept of a "fizz" dates back to at least 1876, with mentions in Jerry Thomas's "The Bartender's Guide."

While the Gin Fizz, particularly the Ramos Gin Fizz, is one of the most famous variations, rum has also been a common ingredient in fizz cocktails. The Rum Fizz is a straightforward and refreshing cocktail that combines white rum with lemon juice, simple syrup, and soda water, creating a bubbly and invigorating drink. It embodies the classic fizz structure, offering a perfect balance of sweet, sour, and effervescent.
