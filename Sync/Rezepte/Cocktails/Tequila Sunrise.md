# History

The history of the Tequila Sunrise cocktail involves two distinct origin stories, leading to two different versions of the drink.



The original Tequila Sunrise is believed to have been created in the 1930s or 1940s by Gene Sulit, a bartender at the Arizona Biltmore Hotel in Phoenix, Arizona. This early version consisted of tequila, soda water, lime juice, and crème de cassis, a blackcurrant liqueur. The dense crème de cassis would settle, creating a gradient of color that resembled a sunrise.



The more widely known and popular modern version of the Tequila Sunrise emerged in the early 1970s. This iteration was created by bartenders Bobby Lozoff and Billy Rice at The Trident bar in Sausalito, California. Their recipe featured tequila, orange juice, and grenadine syrup, which, when poured carefully, creates the iconic layered "sunrise" effect.



The modern Tequila Sunrise gained significant popularity after Mick Jagger of The Rolling Stones tried it at The Trident in 1972. The band reportedly enjoyed the drink so much that they adopted it during their 1972 tour across the United States. This exposure led to its rapid and widespread recognition. Following its surge in popularity, Jose Cuervo began printing the recipe on their tequila bottles in 1973, and the Eagles released a song titled "Tequila Sunrise" in the same year. This recipe, with tequila blanco, orange juice, and grenadine, aligns with the popular modern version of this iconic cocktail.
