# History
The "Park Avenue cocktail" is a vintage drink with a somewhat mysterious origin, believed to date back to around the 1940s. Its name likely refers to the affluent Park Avenue in New York City, a street known for its corporate power and upscale associations, lending the cocktail an air of sophistication.

The earliest known mention of a "Park Avenue" cocktail appears in Dexter Mason's 1930 book "The Art of Living," though the recipe presented there differs significantly from the one commonly recognized today. A recipe more in line with the modern version was found on a 1934 cocktail menu from the Hotel Astor in New York City, as documented in Ted Haigh's 2009 book "Vintage Spirits and Forgotten Cocktails."

The typical modern recipe for a Park Avenue cocktail includes gin, sweet vermouth, pineapple juice, and orange curaçao. This particular recipe features Dry Vermouth, Blanc Vermouth, Gin, and unsweetened Pineapple Juice. It is a variation that uses both dry and blanc vermouth, creating a "perfect" vermouth blend, and unsweetened pineapple juice for a drier, more sophisticated profile. It offers a refreshing and elegant gin-based drink with a subtle fruity note.
