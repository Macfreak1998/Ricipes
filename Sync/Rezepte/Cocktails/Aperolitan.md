# History
The "Aperolitan" cocktail is a modern variation of the classic Cosmopolitan, replacing vodka with Aperol. The name "Aperolitan" itself is a portmanteau of "Aperol" and "Cosmopolitan," directly referencing its key ingredient and the classic cocktail it riffs on.

Aperol was created in Padua, Italy, in 1919 by brothers Luigi and Silvio Barbieri, as a light aperitif with a distinctive bitter-sweet orange flavor. The name "Aperol" is derived from the French word "apéritif."

The Cosmopolitan, which this cocktail is inspired by, is a widely recognized modern classic cocktail. Its exact origin is widely disputed, with several individuals and locations claiming its creation from the 1970s and 1980s. Key figures often credited with its development include Cheryl Cook in Miami and Toby Cecchini in New York. The Cosmopolitan soared to prominence in the 1990s, becoming a symbol of modern cocktail sophistication, significantly boosted by the TV show *Sex and the City*.

The "Aperolitan" blends the bitter-sweet orange notes of Aperol with the fruity and citrusy profile of a Cosmopolitan, creating a refreshing and slightly less potent twist on the popular classic.
