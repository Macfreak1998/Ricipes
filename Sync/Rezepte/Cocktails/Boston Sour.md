# History
The "Boston Sour" is a classic cocktail that distinguishes itself from a traditional Whiskey Sour by the addition of egg white, which imparts a unique silky texture and frothy head.

The roots of the Boston Sour can be traced back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries, evolving from the already established Whiskey Sour. The Whiskey Sour itself has a longer history, with its earliest recorded recipe appearing in Jerry Thomas's 1862 "Bartender's Guide." Its origins are even older, as sailors in the British Navy would mix spirits with citrus juice to prevent scurvy during long voyages.

Bartenders during the late 1800s and early 1900s began experimenting with sour templates, and the inclusion of egg white for "richness" became a notable practice, particularly in New England. The "Boston" moniker likely refers to this regional fondness and the distinguishing characteristic of the egg white. While the simple Whiskey Sour predates it, the Boston Sour's creamy head became emblematic of a more refined cocktail era. Some sources suggest that the term "Boston Sour" gained more formal recognition in the 1930s, appearing in publications like the "Old Mr. Boston Official Bartender's Guide."

At its core, the Boston Sour is a Whiskey Sour—a blend of whiskey (typically bourbon), fresh lemon juice, and simple syrup. The key differentiator is the egg white, which, when properly "dry shaken" (shaken without ice first) and then "wet shaken" (shaken with ice), creates an airy foam. This foam provides a luscious mouthfeel, softens the alcohol's edges, and balances the citrus's bite, offering a visually appealing and texturally enhanced drinking experience.
