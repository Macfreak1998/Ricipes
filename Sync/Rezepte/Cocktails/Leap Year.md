# History
The "Leap Year" cocktail was created by Harry Craddock, a renowned English-American bartender at the Savoy Hotel in London. He invented the drink on February 29, 1928, specifically to celebrate the Leap Year.

The cocktail was first published in Craddock's influential "The Savoy Cocktail Book" in 1930. Craddock famously claimed that the Leap Year cocktail had been "responsible for more proposals than any other cocktail that has ever been mixed." This romantic association is often linked to an old Irish tradition that supposedly allowed women to propose marriage on February 29th.

The original recipe for the Leap Year cocktail is a sophisticated blend of gin, Grand Marnier (an orange liqueur), sweet vermouth, and lemon juice, resulting in a drink that is both slightly sweet and tart. This particular recipe features Gin, Orange Curaçao, Sweet Vermouth, and Lemon Juice, creating a balanced and elegant cocktail perfect for special occasions.
