# History
The "El Burro" cocktail is a name applied to various tequila-based drinks, often serving as a playful nod to its predecessor, the Moscow Mule. "El Burro" translates to "the donkey" in Spanish, cleverly referencing both the pack animal and the Mexican-inspired flavors used in such drinks.

The most recognized "El Burro" cocktail is a tequila-based twist on the classic Moscow Mule, typically including tequila, fresh lime juice, and ginger beer. This version is credited to either the speakeasy "Please Don't Tell" (PDT) in New York or to Henry Besant and Andres Masso in London.

This particular recipe, featuring Reposado Tequila, Pineapple Juice, Lime Juice, Simple Syrup, and Absinthe, is a unique interpretation of an "El Burro" cocktail. It deviates from the traditional ginger beer component, instead offering a fruity and herbaceous profile with the addition of pineapple and a hint of absinthe. This variation creates a complex and intriguing drink, showcasing the versatility of tequila in a tropical and aromatic context.
