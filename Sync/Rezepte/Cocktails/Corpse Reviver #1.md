# History
The "Corpse Reviver #1" is a classic cocktail with a history rooted in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, primarily known for its intended purpose as a hangover cure.

The general concept of a "Corpse Reviver" cocktail, a drink meant to "revive" someone after a night of overindulgence, dates back to the 1850s or 1860s in England. The term itself was used to describe various "hair-of-the-dog" remedies. The first documented recipe for a "Corpse Reviver" appeared in the 1871 "Gentlemen's Table Guide."

The specific recipe for the "Corpse Reviver #1" gained prominence when it was formally published by Harry Craddock in his influential "The Savoy Cocktail Book," which was released in 1930 (though it compiled recipes from the 1890s to the 1930s). Craddock, a renowned bartender at the Savoy Hotel in London, noted that this drink should be consumed "before 11 a.m., or whenever steam and energy are needed."

The name "Corpse Reviver" directly refers to the cocktail's perceived ability to "bring the dead back to life" or "revive" individuals suffering from the effects of heavy drinking. It was considered a restorative potion believed to provide energy and mental clarity.

The "Corpse Reviver #1" is a rich, brandy-based cocktail. Its typical ingredients include Cognac, Calvados (or apple brandy), and Sweet Vermouth. It is often described as tasting like a fruit-forward Manhattan, with the apple brandy and sweet vermouth contributing to its distinct flavor profile. It is important to distinguish it from the more widely known "Corpse Reviver #2," which is a gin-based cocktail with a different set of ingredients.
