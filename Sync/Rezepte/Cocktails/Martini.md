# History
The "Martini" cocktail is a classic and iconic alcoholic beverage with a rich, albeit somewhat mysterious, history and a strong cultural significance. It is widely recognized as a symbol of refinement, elegance, and glamour.

**Origin:**
The exact origin of the Martini is unclear, with several theories circulating:
*   **Martinez, California:** One popular theory suggests it originated around 1870 in Martinez, California, when a gold prospector requested a celebratory drink. This theory often links it to an earlier "Martinez cocktail" documented by 1884, which was a similar iced drink made with gin, vermouth, bitters, and sometimes maraschino liqueur.
*   **Martini & Rossi:** Another suggestion is that the name derived from the Italian vermouth brand Martini and Rossi, with patrons shortening requests for "gin and Martini" to simply "Martini."
*   **Bartenders in Hotels:** Other accounts trace its creation to bartenders in hotels in New York or San Francisco.

**History and Evolution:**
The Martini first appeared around 1870, initially being sweeter and often garnished with fruit like cherries, a stark contrast to today's briny olive or lemon twist. By 1897, the "Dry Martini" emerged, featuring dry gin, Italian (white) vermouth, bitters, and an olive. The recognizable form of the Martini, consisting of a 2:1 ratio of London dry gin to dry vermouth, stirred with ice and strained into a chilled cocktail glass with an olive or lemon twist, was established by 1922.

During the Prohibition era in the United States (1920–1933), the Martini's popularity surged due to the relative ease of illegal gin production. Bartenders often added more vermouth to mask the poor quality of illicit gin, leading to the "wet Martini." After Prohibition, with better quality gin available, the drink progressively became drier, meaning less vermouth was used. The Martini's fame further escalated in the 1950s and 60s, partly due to its association with Hollywood glamour and fictional characters like James Bond. Harry Craddock, a renowned bartender at the Savoy's American Bar, played a significant role in popularizing the "Dry Martini" through his 1930s Savoy Cocktail Book.

**Meaning and Cultural Significance:**
The Martini has earned favor with numerous famous personalities, including Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, William Churchill, and Dorothy Parker, solidifying its status as a cultural icon. The American journalist H.L. Mencken famously called the Martini "the only American invention as perfect as the sonnet." It is typically made with gin and vermouth and garnished with an olive or a lemon twist, though variations like the Vodka Martini (using vodka instead of gin) and the Dirty Martini (with olive brine) are also popular. The image of a V-shaped Martini glass with a single olive is a classic and enduring symbol in cocktail culture.
