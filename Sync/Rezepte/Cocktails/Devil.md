# History
The "Devil" cocktail, as presented in this recipe, does not have a widely documented historical origin or a single, definitive creator. It is likely a unique creation or a less common historical drink, with its name evoking a sense of potency, intrigue, or a "fiery" character.

This particular recipe features Dry Vermouth, Tawny Port, and a dash of Lemon Juice, garnished with a Lemon Zest. This combination suggests a spirit-forward, aromatic, and slightly tart drink, with the Tawny Port contributing a rich, sweet, and nutty complexity. While the name "Devil" is often associated with the "El Diablo" cocktail (a tequila-based drink with crème de cassis and ginger ale), this recipe offers a distinct flavor profile. The name "Devil" in cocktail nomenclature often implies a strong, bold, or perhaps even dangerous drink, reflecting its impact on the drinker.
