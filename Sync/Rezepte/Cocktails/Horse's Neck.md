# History
The "Horse's Neck" cocktail has a rich history, originating in the late 19th century in America, around the 1890s.

Initially, the Horse's Neck was a non-alcoholic beverage. It comprised ginger ale, ice, and a distinctive long, spiraling strip of lemon peel. The drink's name is directly derived from this lemon peel garnish, which is said to resemble a horse's neck as it drapes over the rim of the glass.

By the 1910s, the drink evolved with the addition of alcohol, typically brandy, though whiskey or bourbon were also used. To differentiate it from its non-alcoholic counterpart, this spirited version was often referred to as a "Horse's Neck with a kick" or a "stiff Horse's Neck."

The Horse's Neck gained significant popularity, particularly within the British Royal Navy, where it became a favored drink among officers during the World Wars, eventually replacing the Pink Gin. Its presence also extended to popular culture, appearing in the works of author Ian Fleming, including his James Bond novels, and in various films.

Today, the alcoholic version is the standard, typically featuring brandy or bourbon, ginger ale, and the essential long lemon peel garnish. Bitters are sometimes included to enhance the flavor profile. This particular recipe features Bourbon Whiskey, Angostura Bitters, Orange Bitters, and Ginger Ale, creating a refreshing and aromatic highball.
