# History
The "Dubonnet Highball" is a refreshing long drink that combines Dubonnet, a French aromatized wine, with a carbonated mixer, typically ginger ale, served in a tall glass. This cocktail is a classic example of a highball, a category of drinks characterized by an alcoholic base spirit (or fortified wine in this case) mixed with a larger proportion of a non-alcoholic mixer.

The term "highball" itself is believed to have originated in England around 1767 with the invention of soda water, and gained prominence in the United States in the 1920s. Theories for its name include a railroad signal for "clear track ahead" or "ball" meaning a drink of whiskey in a "high" glass.

Dubonnet, the key ingredient, has a rich history dating back to 1846. It was created by Parisian chemist Joseph Dubonnet as a palatable way to administer quinine, a bitter anti-malarial drug, to French soldiers in North Africa. He infused fortified wine with quinine, along with a secret blend of herbs, spices, and citrus peels. Originally known as "quinquina Dubonnet," it became a popular aperitif and is famously associated with the British Royal Family, particularly Queen Elizabeth II.

The "Dubonnet Highball" combines the sweet, fruity, and slightly bitter notes of Dubonnet with the spicy effervescence of ginger ale, creating a light and refreshing drink. It offers a simple yet elegant way to enjoy Dubonnet, making it a popular choice for an aperitif or a casual drink.
