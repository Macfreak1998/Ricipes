# History
The "Vermouth Cocktail" first appeared around 1868 or 1869, typically consisting of chilled vermouth, a twist of lemon peel, and sometimes a dash of bitters or maraschino. It was a simple yet elegant drink that showcased the versatility of vermouth as a mixer.

Vermouth, an aromatized and fortified wine, has a rich history that predates its widespread use in cocktails. Originally, it was consumed for medicinal purposes, with modern versions emerging in the mid-to-late 18th century in Turin, Italy. The transition from medicine to aperitif began in the late 18th century, particularly in Italy and France.

Vermouth's role as a key cocktail ingredient solidified in the late 19th century. Bartenders discovered its versatility as a mixer, and it became a crucial component in iconic cocktails like the Martini and Manhattan. During the 1880s and 1890s, vermouth-heavy cocktails were particularly popular in America.

This recipe, with dry vermouth, blanc vermouth, and orange bitters, is a classic example of a Vermouth Cocktail, highlighting the nuanced flavors of different vermouths. It is a sophisticated aperitif that allows the complex herbal and aromatic qualities of vermouth to shine.
