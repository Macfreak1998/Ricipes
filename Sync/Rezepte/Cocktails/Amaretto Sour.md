# History
The "Amaretto Sour" is a classic cocktail known for its balance of nutty, sweet, and sour flavors, belonging to the "sour" family of cocktails.

The key ingredient, Amaretto, is an almond-flavored liqueur with Italian roots, specifically from Saronno. A popular legend dates its creation to 1525, when a young innkeeper in Saronno gifted a special almond liqueur to the artist Bernardino Luini. The name "amaretto" is derived from the Italian word "amaro," meaning "a little bitter," despite the liqueur's sweet and nutty profile.

The exact origin of the Amaretto Sour cocktail is somewhat debated. Some sources suggest its popularity surged in the United States during the 1970s, coinciding with the rise of an almond liqueur brand. It was formally introduced to the public in 1974 by the importer of Amaretto di Saronno, initially as a simple mix of two parts amaretto to one part lemon juice. The cocktail gained significant popularity in the 1980s and is believed to have evolved from the whiskey sour. American bartenders began incorporating amaretto into cocktails as early as the 1940s, with the Amaretto Sour becoming a popular choice during the cocktail boom of the 1960s.

The Amaretto Sour is the most popular cocktail made with amaretto. While early versions were often simple, modern recipes frequently include egg white to achieve a smoother, frothy texture and sometimes a splash of bourbon for added depth and complexity.
