# History
The "Mulata" cocktail is a Cuban drink with a history rooted in the mid-20th century, often described as an aged-rum chocolate Daiquiri.

The creation of the Mulata cocktail is generally attributed to the 1940s in Havana, Cuba. While some sources credit Constantino (Constante) Ribalaigua Vert, a renowned bartender at the famous Floridita bar, others suggest Jose Maria Vazquez as the originator.

The original recipe featured Elíxir Bacardi, a proprietary Bacardi cordial with caramel and raisin flavors. However, after Bacardi's departure from Cuba led to the discontinuation of Elíxir Bacardi, crème de cacao became the standard substitute for the chocolate component, starting in the 1970s.

The name "Mulata" likely refers to the cocktail's rich, dark hue, which comes from its ingredients like aged rum and chocolate liqueur. This color evokes the term "mulata," historically used to describe a woman of mixed European and African heritage.

Today, the Mulata cocktail typically consists of aged rum, crème de cacao (often a combination of dark and white), fresh lime juice, and sometimes a touch of simple syrup or demerara syrup. This particular recipe features Lime Juice, Crème de Cacao White, Simple Syrup, and White Rum, creating a refreshing and chocolate-accented rum drink.
