# History
The "Truffle Martini" is a modern and decadent variation of the classic Martini cocktail, distinguished by the infusion of truffle oil, typically white truffle oil. This addition imparts a luxurious, earthy richness, creating a sophisticated and savory flavor profile. One account traces its popularization to a bar in Yokohama around 2019.

The classic Martini itself has a long and debated history, with several theories regarding its origin:
*   **The Martinez Cocktail:** One theory suggests it evolved from the "Martinez" cocktail, served in the 1860s in California.
*   **Martini & Rossi Vermouth:** Another theory proposes the name came from the Italian Martini brand of vermouth.
*   **Bartender Martini di Arma di Taggia:** Some sources suggest a bartender named Martini di Arma di Taggia at the Knickerbocker Hotel in New York City invented the drink in 1911.

Regardless of its exact origin, the classic Martini, a blend of gin and vermouth, became widely recognized by 1922. The Truffle Martini builds upon this iconic foundation, offering a unique and aromatic experience.
