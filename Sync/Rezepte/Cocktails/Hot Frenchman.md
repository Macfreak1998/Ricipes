# History
The "Hot Frenchman" cocktail is a classic warm drink originating from France, traditionally enjoyed for centuries to combat cold weather. Its name directly reflects its French heritage and its characteristic of being served hot.

The cocktail is known for its comforting and warming qualities, described as a beverage that "warms you from the inside out" and "warms your soul," making it ideal for chilly evenings.

While specific recipes can vary, common ingredients in a "Hot Frenchman" typically include a base spirit such as brandy or red wine, an orange liqueur (frequently Grand Marnier or Triple Sec), hot water, sweeteners like sugar or honey, and citrus juices (often lemon and/or orange). Some variations may also include spices such as cloves or cinnamon.

This particular recipe features Red Wine, Grand Marnier, Sugar, Orange Juice, and Lemon Juice, creating a rich, fruity, and warming drink perfect for cold weather.
