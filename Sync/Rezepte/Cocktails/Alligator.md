# History
The "Alligator" cocktail does not refer to a single, universally recognized drink, but rather to several distinct recipes that share the name. This particular version, featuring Fernet Branca, lime juice, orange liqueur, and cinnamon syrup, was created by bartender Dante Wheat in Louisville, Kentucky. It is sometimes described as a "margarita riff."

An older version of the "Alligator" cocktail dates back to *Cocktails de Paris* (1929), calling for gin, orgeat, and Eau de Melisse. Other variations, often characterized by their vibrant green color (derived from melon liqueur), are popular for their visual appeal and fruity taste, likely contributing to the "Alligator" name by evoking the reptile's color. The specific meaning behind Dante Wheat naming his creation "Alligator" is not explicitly stated in the search results.
