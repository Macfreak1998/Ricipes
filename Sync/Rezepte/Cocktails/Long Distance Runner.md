# History
The "Long Distance Runner" cocktail, as presented in this recipe, is a modern and creative drink that does not have a widely documented historical origin. The name "Long Distance Runner" likely evokes a sense of endurance, refreshment, and the need for a revitalizing beverage, perhaps after physical exertion or during a long, hot day.

This particular recipe features Fresh Mint, Lime Juice, Pineapple Juice, and Passion Fruit Syrup, blended with crushed ice. This combination creates a vibrant, tropical, and highly refreshing drink. The blend of lime and pineapple juices provides a tart and sweet base, while passion fruit syrup adds an exotic floral note. Fresh mint contributes a cooling and aromatic element, making it an ideal thirst-quencher. It is notable for being a non-alcoholic or low-alcohol option, focusing on the refreshing qualities of fruit and mint, making it suitable for sustained enjoyment.
