# History
The "Blood and Sand" cocktail is a classic drink with a name directly inspired by popular culture of its time. It first gained widespread recognition when it was featured in Harry Craddock's influential *The Savoy Cocktail Book*, published in 1930. While its first appearance in print was in this book, it is generally believed that the cocktail existed prior to its inclusion, with Craddock likely compiling existing recipes.

The "Blood and Sand" cocktail is named after the 1922 silent film of the same title, a bullfighting drama starring Rudolph Valentino. The film was a significant box office hit, and the cocktail's name is thought to be a direct reference to its dramatic and colorful scenes.

The ingredients of the cocktail are said to visually represent elements of the film's theme:
*   **"Blood"** refers to the reddish hue contributed by the cherry liqueur (such as Cherry Heering) or, when used, blood orange juice.
*   **"Sand"** is represented by the color of the Scotch whisky, which forms the base of the drink.

The "Blood and Sand" is distinctive for being one of the few classic cocktails to feature Scotch whisky. It typically consists of equal parts Scotch whisky, cherry liqueur (or cherry brandy), sweet vermouth, and fresh orange juice.
