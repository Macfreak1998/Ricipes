# History
The "Añejo Highball" is a sophisticated cocktail with a relatively modern origin, credited to the renowned bartender Dale DeGroff, often called "King Cocktail."

The cocktail was created by Dale DeGroff in the late 1990s, specifically between 1997 and 1999, during his tenure at New York's historic Rainbow Room. DeGroff played a significant role in the craft cocktail revival of the late 20th century, and the Añejo Highball was a staple on the Rainbow Room's menu. It is considered one of his own inventions, though it serves as a tribute to the Cuban cocktail mixers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, particularly an "ode to Havana Barman Constantino Ribalaigua."

The primary purpose behind the Añejo Highball's creation was to showcase the nuanced qualities of añejo (aged) rum in a refreshing and approachable manner. Unlike many sweeter or more elaborate rum-based drinks, this cocktail is refined and straightforward, emphasizing the elegance and complexity of its ingredients. It embodies DeGroff's mission to bring balance, simplicity, and elegance back to cocktail culture. The drink is a brilliant example of balance, where the depth of aged rum intertwines with vibrant citrus and a gentle ginger spice. It's designed to be a rum-forward highball that allows the aged rum to shine through, pairing beautifully with ginger beer. The Añejo Highball has earned its place as a modern classic due to its balanced profile of spice, citrus, and smooth oakiness.
