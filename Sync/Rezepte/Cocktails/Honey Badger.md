# History
The Honey Badger is a modern craft cocktail created by Liam Baer from Fish and Meat in Hong Kong. The cocktail was created as an homage to the Penicillin, one of the most influential modern classic cocktails created by Sam Ross in 2005.

In the original Penicillin recipe, rosemary-infused bourbon whiskey is used to add herbaceous complexity. Liam Baer simplified the preparation by muddling fresh rosemary directly with the whiskey in the shaker, making the drink more accessible to home bartenders while maintaining the aromatic rosemary character.

The name "Honey Badger" is a playful reference that works on multiple levels: it acknowledges the honey syrup in the recipe, references the internet-famous "honey badger don't care" meme (suggesting the drink's bold, unapologetic flavor profile), and hints at the cocktail's fierce, complex character.

**Flavor Profile:**

The Honey Badger combines bourbon's vanilla and oak notes with Yellow Chartreuse's herbal complexity (a lighter, sweeter counterpart to Green Chartreuse), honey's floral sweetness, and ginger's warming spice. The muddled rosemary adds an aromatic, pine-like quality that ties all elements together, while black lemon bitters provide citrus depth and a subtle bitter backbone.

The cocktail represents modern bartending's approach to creating accessible versions of complex drinks. By eliminating the infusion step (which requires advance preparation), Baer made the Penicillin template more practical for busy bars and home cocktail enthusiasts.

The drink has gained popularity on Instagram via @philsdrinks, introducing it to a wider audience and cementing its place as a contemporary craft cocktail worth knowing.
