# History
The Red Seal of Shimoda cocktail draws its name and inspiration from the Japanese port city of Shimoda, which holds historical significance as the first Japanese port opened to Western trade in 1854. This historical East-meets-West theme is reflected in the cocktail's ingredients, which include ruby port and a blend of flavors from both Eastern and Western culinary traditions.

This is a modern cocktail, with Gavin Humes, Director of Operations and Sake Sommelier for Scratch Restaurants Group, recently adding it to their menu. The drink typically features Suntory Toki Whisky, pomegranate juice, ruby port, lemon juice, and honey. A distinctive element of the cocktail is its green rim, which is made from matcha green tea salt, further emphasizing the fusion of cultures. It is a sophisticated and flavorful drink that bridges historical context with contemporary mixology.
