# History
The "Manhattan Perfect" cocktail is a variation of the classic Manhattan cocktail, distinguished by its use of equal proportions of both sweet vermouth and dry vermouth. In cocktail terminology, "Perfect" signifies this specific balance of vermouths, rather than implying flawlessness.

The Manhattan cocktail, a timeless classic, boasts a rich and somewhat debated history, but its emergence in New York City during the 1860s-1870s is widely accepted. It is often considered the first "modern cocktail" due to its innovative inclusion of vermouth, an aromatized and fortified wine, which distinguished it from earlier whiskey cocktails. One popular, though largely discredited, theory suggests the Manhattan was created by Iain Marshall at the Manhattan Club in the mid-1870s for a banquet hosted by Lady Randolph Churchill. A more plausible origin points to a bartender named Black, who is said to have invented the drink at his bar on Broadway near Houston Street in the 1860s, possibly naming it after his establishment, the Manhattan Inn.

The traditional Manhattan cocktail is made with whiskey (rye is the classic choice, though bourbon, Canadian, or blended whiskey are also used), sweet vermouth, and bitters, typically Angostura. It is prepared by stirring the ingredients with ice, straining them into a chilled cocktail glass, and garnishing with a maraschino cherry.

The "Perfect Manhattan" features whiskey (rye or bourbon), equal parts dry vermouth and sweet vermouth, and bitters. This balance of vermouths results in a cocktail that is less sweet and drier than a classic Manhattan, offering a more nuanced flavor with subtle herbal and floral notes. It is often garnished with a lemon twist, especially when dry vermouth is included. This particular recipe features Rye Whiskey, Dry Vermouth, Sweet Vermouth, Angostura Bitters, and a Cherry, creating a balanced and sophisticated rendition of the classic.
