# History
The "Russian Cadillac" cocktail appears to be a modern variation within the family of creamy, vodka-based "Russian" cocktails, such as the White Russian and Black Russian. While its exact historical origin is not widely documented, it shares a similar structure with these drinks, often featuring vodka, a liqueur, and cream.

This cocktail is particularly reminiscent of the "Golden Cadillac," a drink invented in 1952 at Poor Red's restaurant in El Dorado, California. The Golden Cadillac typically uses Galliano, white crème de cacao, and cream, but with orange liqueur as its base. The "Russian Cadillac" likely emerged as a variation, substituting vodka for the orange liqueur to give it a "Russian" twist due to vodka's association with Russia.

The "Russian Cadillac" combines vodka, Galliano, white crème de cacao, and cream, creating a rich, sweet, and herbaceous dessert-style cocktail. It's a luxurious and indulgent drink, fitting the "Cadillac" moniker, and is a testament to the ongoing creativity in cocktail development.
