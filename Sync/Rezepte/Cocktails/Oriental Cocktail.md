# History
The Oriental Cocktail is a pre-Prohibition classic cocktail featured by @theeducatedbarfly with the note: "Adapted from a recipe on the Savoy Cocktail book which notes that in 1924 an oriental man with a fever in the Philippines gifted this recipe to the doctor who saved his life in order to say thank you."

**The Origin Story:**

The cocktail first appeared in Harry Craddock's iconic 1930 "Savoy Cocktail Book," one of the most influential cocktail books ever published. Craddock's note about the 1924 Philippines origin—an unnamed Asian man giving the recipe to his doctor as thanks for saving his life—is a romantic, likely apocryphal story typical of cocktail mythology from this era.

**Historical Context:**

The 1920s Philippines was under American colonial administration, and Manila had a vibrant international cocktail culture mixing American, Spanish, and Asian influences. Many pre-Prohibition bartenders and drinkers fled to international destinations during American Prohibition (1920-1933), spreading cocktail culture globally. This explains how a recipe from the Philippines ended up in London's Savoy Hotel cocktail book.

**The Name:**

"Oriental" was the standard Western term for East Asian/Southeast Asian regions in the early 20th century. While the term has fallen out of favor in modern usage due to its Orientalist connotations, it was commonplace in 1920s-1930s cocktail nomenclature. The name likely references both the drink's origin story and the inclusion of lime (associated with tropical/Asian flavors).

**Flavor Profile:**

The Oriental Cocktail balances several elements:

- **Rye Whiskey** (1.5 oz): Spicy, grain-forward base
- **Sweet Vermouth** (0.75 oz): Herbal wine character adds complexity
- **Triple Sec** (0.75 oz): Orange liqueur provides sweetness and citrus
- **Lime Juice** (0.5 oz): Tartness and tropical brightness

This creates a drink that sits somewhere between a Manhattan (rye + sweet vermouth) and a Sidecar (spirit + triple sec + citrus), showing how pre-Prohibition bartenders freely mixed templates.

**Why It Was Forgotten:**

Despite appearing in the Savoy Cocktail Book, the Oriental never achieved the fame of other drinks from that era. It likely suffered from:
- A name that became culturally problematic
- Competition from more famous whiskey cocktails (Manhattan, Old Fashioned)
- An unusual combination that doesn't fit cleanly into established families

**Modern Revival:**

The Educated Barfly's inclusion of this cocktail reflects contemporary cocktail culture's archaeological approach—digging through historical cocktail books to rediscover forgotten gems. Bartenders like DiMonriva research pre-Prohibition recipes, test them, and adapt them for modern palates.

**The "Straight-Up Offensive Names" Series:**

DiMonriva specifically noted this drink isn't "cutting it for sensitivity in 2025," acknowledging the problematic nature of historical cocktail names while still preserving the recipes themselves. This represents modern bartenders' challenge: how to honor cocktail history while recognizing that historical contexts often included racist, sexist, or culturally insensitive naming.

The Oriental Cocktail demonstrates the complexity of cocktail preservation—the recipe itself is delicious and historically significant, but its name and origin story reflect colonialism and Orientalism that require critical examination.
