# History
The "Bebbo" cocktail is an obscure drink believed to be a descendant of the 1920s classic, the Bee's Knees. The Bee's Knees, made with gin, lemon juice, and honey, gained popularity during Prohibition as the strong flavors helped to mask the taste of lower-quality "bathtub gin." The Bebbo cocktail essentially adds orange juice to the Bee's Knees recipe.

The cocktail's name, "Bebbo," is derived from the Konkani word for "frog," a dialect spoken in India. However, this meaning has no apparent connection to the drink's ingredients or appearance, leading some to consider it an "idiotically named drink."

The recipe for a Bebbo cocktail typically includes gin, lemon juice, orange juice, and honey. Modern variations often suggest using blood orange juice for a more vibrant color and a slightly sweeter, tangier flavor profile. The cocktail was brought to wider attention through Ted Haigh's book, "Vintage Spirits and Forgotten Cocktails."
