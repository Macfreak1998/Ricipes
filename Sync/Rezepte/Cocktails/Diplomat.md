# History
The "Diplomat" cocktail, a low-alcohol aperitif, has a history dating back to at least 1922, when it was first published in bartender Robert Vermeire's "Cocktails: How to Mix Them." Originally spelled "Diplomate" in Vermeire's book, it was noted as being "very well known in the French Diplomatic Service." The cocktail also appeared in "The Savoy Cocktail Book" in 1930 and subsequent publications like "Cocktail Bill Boothby's World Drinks" (1934).

The meaning behind its name is rooted in its composition: a relatively low-alcohol content drink designed to allow diplomats to partake in social functions without compromising their faculties. This enabled them to maintain their composure and judgment while engaging in sensitive state business, even while appearing to indulge in their host's hospitality.

The basic recipe for a Diplomat cocktail typically features a blend of dry and sweet vermouth, along with a small measure of maraschino liqueur. Many modern variations also include a dash or two of bitters to enhance its balance and flavor. This particular recipe features Dry Vermouth, Sweet Vermouth, Maraschino Liqueur, and Orange Bitters, garnished with a Lemon Zest and a Cherry, offering a sophisticated and balanced profile.
