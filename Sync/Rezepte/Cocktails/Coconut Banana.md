# History
The "Coconut Banana" is not a single, universally recognized cocktail, but rather a popular flavor combination appearing in various tropical and dessert-style drinks. Its history and meaning are intertwined with the broader use of coconut and banana in mixed drinks, particularly within Tiki culture.

This recipe is for the "Coconut Banana Alexander," a variation of the classic Alexander cocktail. The Alexander cocktail first appeared in print in Hugo Ensslin's 1915 book, "Recipes for Mixed Drinks." Its creation is often attributed to a New York bartender named Troy Alexander or possibly in honor of baseball pitcher Grover Cleveland Alexander. The "Coconut Banana" adaptation is a more modern, experimental concept.

The use of coconut in cocktails has a long history, with sailors in the 1700s reportedly using coconuts to store and conceal liquor. The proliferation of coconut in Western cocktail culture was significantly boosted by the rise of Tiki cocktails and the introduction of coconut-flavored rum like Malibu in 1978. The "Coconut Banana" flavor profile, and coconut cocktails in general, evoke images of beach vacations, tropical getaways, and a carefree, summery vibe. The combination of coconut and banana often signifies an exotic and indulgent experience.
