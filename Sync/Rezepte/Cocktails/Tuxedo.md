# History

The Tuxedo cocktail, a classic gin-based drink, traces its origins back to the late 19th century, specifically to the Tuxedo Club in Orange County, New York. This exclusive social club, founded in 1886, is also credited with introducing the "tuxedo" dinner jacket to American society, a garment that shares its name with the cocktail. Both the drink and the formalwear derive their name from "tucseto," a native Lenape word associated with the area.



Initially, the Tuxedo cocktail was likely created around the 1880s or 1890s. Early versions sometimes included sherry. However, the cocktail quickly evolved, with various recipes appearing in New York bar manuals in the early 1900s.



A significant iteration, often referred to as the "Tuxedo No. 2," emerged, incorporating maraschino liqueur and an absinthe rinse for added sweetness and aromatics. This version was documented in Harry Johnson's 1900 *Bartender's Manual*, one of the earliest known print references for the Tuxedo No. 2. Other legendary bartenders like Harry MacElhone and Harry Craddock also recorded their versions, with the cocktail being immortalized in *The Savoy Cocktail Book*.



This recipe, with Old Tom Gin, dry vermouth, orange bitters, maraschino liqueur, and absinthe, aligns with the "Tuxedo No. 2" version, known for its herbal complexity and aromatic profile. It is considered a cousin of the Martini, belonging to the "Fancy Martinis" category popular in late 19th-century America.
