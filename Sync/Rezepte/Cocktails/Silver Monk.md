# History

The Silver Monk cocktail was created in 2007 by mixologist Phil Ward while he was working at Death & Co in New York City. Ward is recognized for his contributions to cocktail culture, including other notable drinks like the Oaxaca Old Fashioned.



This tequila-based cocktail is known for its fresh and herbal profile, achieved through the combination of blanco tequila, mint, cucumber, and Yellow Chartreuse, balanced with lime juice and simple syrup. The "Monk" in its name is a tribute to the French Carthusian monks who produce Chartreuse, an essential ingredient. A distinctive element of the Silver Monk's preparation is the inclusion of a pinch of salt during the muddling of mint and cucumber, which helps to enhance the overall flavor. The recipe for the Silver Monk is also featured in the book "Death & Co: Modern Classic Cocktails." This recipe, with tequila blanco, Yellow Chartreuse, lime juice, simple syrup, cucumber, and fresh mint, is a classic example of this modern and innovative cocktail.
