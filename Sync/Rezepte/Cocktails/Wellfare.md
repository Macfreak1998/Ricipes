# History

There does not appear to be a widely recognized historical cocktail specifically named the "Wellfare cocktail." This suggests it is likely a modern creation or a local variation, rather than a historically established classic.



The recipe, with gin, green crème de menthe, cucumber, rosemary, and bitter lemon, suggests a refreshing, herbaceous, and slightly sweet drink. The combination of gin and crème de menthe is reminiscent of some classic cocktails, but the addition of fresh cucumber and rosemary, along with bitter lemon, points to a contemporary approach to mixology.



This cocktail likely emerged from the creativity of modern bartenders experimenting with fresh ingredients and unique flavor combinations to create a drink that is both appealing and perhaps evokes a sense of well-being or freshness, aligning with the name "Wellfare." It's a testament to the ongoing innovation in the cocktail world.
