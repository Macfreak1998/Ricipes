# History
The "Resucitador" cocktail, whose name is Spanish for "resuscitator," is a tequila-based variation of the classic "Corpse Reviver" cocktails. The Corpse Reviver family of drinks has a history stretching back to the 19th century, originally conceived as potent remedies for hangovers, known for their "back-to-life qualities."

The most famous iteration, the Corpse Reviver #2, was popularized by Harry Craddock's *Savoy Cocktail Book* in 1930. It typically features gin, Lillet Blanc, Cointreau, fresh lemon juice, and a dash of absinthe.

This "Resucitador" recipe closely mirrors the structure of a Corpse Reviver #2, but substitutes gin with Tequila Blanco and absinthe with Mezcal. This gives the drink a distinct Mexican twist, while still retaining the refreshing, citrusy, and slightly herbaceous characteristics that make the Corpse Reviver so effective as a "resuscitator." The combination of tequila and mezcal adds a smoky depth, making it a unique and modern interpretation of a classic hangover cure.
