# History
The "Morning Glory Fizz" cocktail emerged in the 1880s as a popular "eye-opener" or "pick-me-up" drink, intended for morning consumption. Its creation is often attributed to Harry Johnson, a prominent bartender of the golden age of mixology, who included the recipe in his "New and Improved Bartender's Manual," first published in 1882. O.H. Byron also featured the cocktail in "The Modern Bartender's Guide" in 1884 or 1894, describing it as a "nerve quieter" and a tonic.

The meaning behind the Morning Glory Fizz lies in its intended purpose: to stimulate the appetite and calm the nerves at the start of the day. In the 19th century, it was common for gentlemen to begin their mornings with a spirit-based drink, and the Morning Glory Fizz was part of a category of cocktails designed for this purpose, alongside others like the Corpse Reviver and Eye Opener. While it gained a reputation as a hangover cure, Harry Johnson himself never explicitly claimed it as such, instead emphasizing its role as an excellent morning beverage.

As its name suggests, the Morning Glory Fizz belongs to the "fizz" family of cocktails, which typically consist of a spirit, lemon, sugar, and carbonated water. Fizzes became popular in the latter half of the 19th century, with early recipes appearing in Jerry Thomas' "Bartender's Guide" in 1876. The Morning Glory Fizz specifically distinguishes itself from other fizzes by its use of Scotch whisky and absinthe (or Pernod, as in this recipe), along with lemon juice, simple syrup, soda water, and egg white. The "Morning Glory" part of the name also alludes to the resilient bindweed flower that opens with the first sunbeams, and can also refer to cheerful early risers, suggesting the cocktail's role in helping one face the morning.
