# History
The "Voldemort cocktail" does not refer to a single, historically established drink with a definitive origin. Instead, it is a category of modern, Harry Potter-themed cocktails inspired by Lord Voldemort and elements associated with him. These drinks have emerged from fan culture and food blogging, with various creators developing their own unique recipes.

This particular recipe, with gin, crème de violette, elderflower liqueur (Holunderblütenlikör), and lemon juice, creates a visually striking and complex cocktail. The crème de violette gives it a mysterious, dark hue, while the elderflower and lemon juice add a floral and tart balance. The gin provides a classic base, making it a sophisticated yet playful tribute to the Dark Lord. It's a testament to the creativity within fandoms to translate fictional elements into tangible, enjoyable experiences.
