# History
The "Honey Bee" cocktail is a delightful variation of the classic "Bee's Knees" cocktail, which has a rich history rooted in the Prohibition era in the 1920s in the United States.

The original Bee's Knees cocktail was created to mask the harsh taste of poorly made, bootlegged spirits prevalent during Prohibition, with gin being one of the most accessible liquors at the time. The honey and lemon in the cocktail helped to make the gin more palatable. While its exact origins are somewhat unclear, the creation of the Bee's Knees is often attributed to Frank Meier, an Austrian-born bartender at the Hotel Ritz in Paris in 1921, or to American socialite Margaret Brown. The name "Bee's Knees" comes from a popular slang term used in the 1920s, meaning "amazing," "the best," or "top-notch."

This "Honey Bee" recipe takes the core concept of the Bee's Knees (honey and citrus) and adapts it with Jamaican White Rum and Orange Juice. This substitution of gin with rum and the addition of orange juice creates a tropical and fruity twist on the classic, offering a refreshing and slightly sweeter flavor profile. It embodies the spirit of adaptation and creativity in mixology, building upon a historical classic to create a new, distinct experience.
