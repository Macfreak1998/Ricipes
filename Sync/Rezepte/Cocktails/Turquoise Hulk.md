# History
The Turquoise Hulk is a modern craft cocktail featured by @theeducatedbarfly with an evocative introduction: "The way this was edited makes it sound like the drink is the Turquoise Hulk but in reality it's the Incredible Hulk, an infamous club drink I used to sling working in Hollywood Night Clubs at the beginning of my career. The Turquoise Hulk,, is my take on that drink, reconstructed with simple delicious ingredients. Hope yall enjoy!"

**The Incredible Hulk:**

The original Incredible Hulk was a notorious club drink from the 1990s-2000s, typically made with:
- **Cognac** (or Hennessy specifically)
- **Hypnotiq** (a bright blue liqueur made with vodka, cognac, and tropical fruit juices)

The drink became famous in hip-hop culture and urban nightclubs, associated with bottle service and VIP sections. Its electric blue color made it Instagram-worthy before Instagram existed, and its strong alcohol content made it effective for its intended purpose.

**Hollywood Night Club Culture:**

DiMonriva's reference to "slinging" this drink in Hollywood nightclubs situates the original in a specific time and place—Los Angeles club culture of the 2000s, where:
- Visual presentation was crucial
- Strong drinks were the norm
- Celebrity culture influenced drink menus
- Cognac (especially Hennessy) signaled status

**The Reconstruction:**

The Turquoise Hulk reimagines the original with craft cocktail sensibilities:

**Original Incredible Hulk:**
- Cognac
- Hypnotiq (artificial, overly sweet)
- Simple, two-ingredient formula

**Turquoise Hulk:**
- **Cognac** (maintains the original's base)
- **Vodka** (replaces some of Hypnotiq's vodka component)
- **Blue Curaçao** (provides blue color from actual orange liqueur)
- **Pineapple Juice** (fresh tropical flavor, not artificial)
- **Lime Juice** (adds tartness and balance)
- **Simple Syrup** (minimal, controlled sweetness)

**The Color:**

Both drinks are bright blue/turquoise, but the Turquoise Hulk achieves this through Blue Curaçao (orange liqueur with blue coloring) rather than Hypnotiq's artificial blue. This maintains visual impact while using a more respectable ingredient.

**The Philosophy:**

DiMonriva's "reconstructed with simple delicious ingredients" approach represents modern bartending's relationship with club drinks:
- **Respect the original**: Don't dismiss drinks just because they were popular in clubs
- **Improve the technique**: Use fresh ingredients instead of bottled mixes
- **Maintain the spirit**: Keep what made it fun (color, strength, tropical flavors)
- **Elevate the execution**: Apply craft cocktail knowledge

**The Name Evolution:**

Changing "Incredible Hulk" to "Turquoise Hulk" serves multiple purposes:
- Distinguishes the craft version from the club original
- Emphasizes the color (turquoise) over the character reference
- Signals that this is a different, refined take
- Avoids potential trademark issues

**Hollywood Club Memories:**

The personal note—"I used to sling working in Hollywood Night Clubs at the beginning of my career"—adds authenticity. This isn't a bartender looking down on club drinks; it's someone who made thousands of them, understands their appeal, and wants to show they can be better.

**Cultural Reclamation:**

The Turquoise Hulk represents cocktail culture's growing comfort with its recent past. The 2000s club scene was dismissed by early craft cocktail culture as unsophisticated, but bartenders who actually worked those clubs are now reclaiming and improving those drinks, proving that fun, colorful, strong cocktails have a place in modern bar culture.

**The Power Dynamic:**

Creating a "reconstructed" version also makes a statement: these drinks deserve the same treatment as pre-Prohibition classics—researched, refined, and respected. If we can lovingly recreate 1920s drinks with modern technique, why not do the same for 2000s club drinks?

The Turquoise Hulk proves that cocktail history isn't just canonical classics—it's also the drinks that real people actually ordered and enjoyed, even if they came from places craft cocktail culture initially rejected.
