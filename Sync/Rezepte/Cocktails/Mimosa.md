# History
The "Mimosa" cocktail is a popular drink known for its vibrant color and refreshing taste, typically made with champagne or sparkling wine and chilled orange juice. Its name is derived from the bright yellow, fragrant flowers of the *Acacia dealbata* plant, also known as the mimosa flower, due to the cocktail's similar hue.

The exact origin of the Mimosa is debated, with several theories:
*   **Paris, 1925:** Many sources attribute the creation of the Mimosa to Frank Meier, a bartender at the Ritz Hotel in Paris, around 1925.
*   **Buck's Fizz, London, 1921:** The Mimosa is often considered a variation of the Buck's Fizz cocktail, which originated in 1921 at the Buck's Club in London. The primary distinction lies in the ratio of ingredients: Buck's Fizz traditionally uses twice as much champagne as orange juice, while the Mimosa typically calls for equal parts.
*   **French Riviera, 1920s-1930s:** Some accounts suggest the cocktail emerged in the cafes of the French Riviera during the 1920s or 1930s.
*   **Alfred Hitchcock, San Francisco, 1940s:** A less substantiated theory suggests that film director Alfred Hitchcock either created or significantly popularized the Mimosa in the United States in the 1940s, contributing to its widespread adoption in American brunch culture by the 1960s.

Culturally, the Mimosa has become a staple for brunch and is frequently served at festive occasions such as weddings. It is widely regarded as a symbol of sophisticated indulgence and a beloved weekend tradition.
