# History
The Queens Park Swizzle is a classic rum cocktail that originated in Trinidad, specifically at the Queen's Park Hotel in Port of Spain, in the 1920s. It was likely created as a signature drink for the hotel, which was a popular destination and trade center.

The cocktail is a prominent member of a genre of West Indian "swizzle" drinks, characterized by being stirred with a swizzle stick until the glass frosts. The original swizzle sticks were traditionally made from a tree native to the Caribbean called Quararibea turbinata, also known as the swizzle stick tree.

The Queens Park Swizzle shares similar ingredients with the Mojito, including rum, lime juice, sugar, and mint. However, a key distinguishing ingredient is Angostura bitters, a famous export from Trinidad, which is added to the drink. The House of Angostura has even promoted it as Trinidad and Tobago's national drink. The drink gained significant popularity, with Trader Vic famously calling it "the most delightful form of anesthesia given out today" in 1946. Although the original Queen's Park Hotel closed in 1996, the Queens Park Swizzle remains a staple in tiki and rum bars worldwide.
