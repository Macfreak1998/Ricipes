# History
The Cinnamon Appletini is a modern variation of the Appletini, a popular cocktail that emerged in the 1990s. The original Appletini, a mix of vodka and apple schnapps, was known for its sweet and sour taste and vibrant green color.

The Cinnamon Appletini adds a warm and spicy twist to the original recipe. This version uses Calvados, an apple brandy from Normandy, France, which gives it a more complex and sophisticated flavor profile than the vodka-based original. The addition of cinnamon syrup further enhances the apple pie-like character of the drink, making it a popular choice for autumn and winter.
