# History
The "Fernandito" cocktail, a popular Argentine drink, has a rich history rooted in the country's unique palate and social culture.

The Fernandito originated in Córdoba, Argentina, evolving from the combination of the Italian digestive Fernet Branca and cola. While some accounts suggest its existence as early as the 1950s, its creation is often attributed to Oscar "el Negro" Becerra, a bartender from Córdoba, who is said to have popularized it in the 1970s.

The drink's popularity grew significantly in the early 2000s throughout Argentina. Recognizing its increasing demand, Fratelli Branca (producers of Fernet Branca) and the Coca-Cola Company launched a joint national advertising campaign in Argentina in the 1990s to further boost its widespread appeal. Its cultural significance was officially recognized in 2020 when the Fernandito became the first Argentine drink to be listed as an official cocktail by the International Bartenders Association (IBA) in the "new era drinks" category.

The Fernandito has transcended its status as a mere beverage to become a powerful symbol of Argentine identity, especially in social gatherings. It embodies the Argentine preference for a balance of bitter and sweet flavors. The drink's deep integration into Argentine culture is evident in the fact that the country consumes over 75% of all Fernet produced worldwide. It is a ubiquitous presence in Argentine bars and is gaining recognition in other parts of South America and among the Argentine diaspora globally.
