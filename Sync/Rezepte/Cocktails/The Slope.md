# History

The Slope cocktail was created in 2009 by bartender Julie Reiner for the Clover Club, her bar in Brooklyn, New York. Reiner named the drink after Park Slope, the Brooklyn neighborhood where she resided at the time.



The cocktail was conceived as a "house Manhattan" for the Clover Club and is considered a variation within the "Brooklyn family" of cocktails, which are modern riffs on the classic Manhattan. The Slope cocktail is characterized by its use of rye whiskey, Punt e Mes (a vermouth amaro hybrid that provides a bitter element, though this recipe uses sweet vermouth), apricot liqueur, and a dash of Angostura bitters. It is described as a stirred, spirit-forward drink that offers a balanced blend of rye, the complexity of aromatized wine, and a rich, fruity note from the apricot.



This recipe, with rye whiskey, sweet vermouth, apricot liqueur, and Angostura bitters, aligns with the spirit of Reiner's creation, offering a sophisticated and balanced cocktail.
