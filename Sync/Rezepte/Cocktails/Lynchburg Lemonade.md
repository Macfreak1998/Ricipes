# History
The "Lynchburg Lemonade" is a popular and refreshing cocktail with a history rooted in the early 1980s, though its origins are marked by some controversy.

The cocktail is widely attributed to Tony Mason, a bar owner in Huntsville, Alabama, who created the drink in 1980. It quickly gained popularity, but its fame led to a legal dispute. Mason sued the Jack Daniel's distillery, claiming they marketed his recipe without proper credit or compensation. Although the court ultimately ruled against Mason, the lawsuit brought significant attention to the cocktail and cemented its place in mixology history.

The name "Lynchburg Lemonade" pays homage to Lynchburg, Tennessee, which is famously the home of the Jack Daniel's distillery. The drink was conceived to showcase Jack Daniel's Tennessee whiskey in a lighter, more approachable cocktail, embodying Southern hospitality. It has since become a symbol of Southern hospitality and the innovative spirit of American mixology, often enjoyed at social gatherings like barbecues and parties.

The classic Lynchburg Lemonade typically includes Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey, triple sec, fresh lemon juice (or sweet and sour mix), and lemon-lime soda or soda water. This particular recipe features Bourbon/Rye Whiskey, Dry Curaçao, Lime Juice, Lemon Juice, and Sprite, creating a vibrant and refreshing variation that maintains the spirit of the original.
