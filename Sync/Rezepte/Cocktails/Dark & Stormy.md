# History
The Dark & Stormy is a classic highball cocktail with a history that is as dramatic as its name. The drink originated in Bermuda after World War I and is deeply connected to the Gosling family, who have been making rum on the island since 1806.

The story goes that the cocktail was invented when members of a British Royal Navy officers' club, who had a penchant for drinking Goslings Black Seal Rum, decided to mix it with the spicy ginger beer that was also being brewed on the island. A sailor is said to have commented that the drink's murky appearance resembled "a cloud only a fool or a dead man would sail under," and the name "Dark & Stormy" was born.

Goslings has trademarked the name, so technically, a drink can only be called a Dark & Stormy if it is made with Goslings Black Seal Rum. The official recipe is simple: just rum and ginger beer, with a lime wedge for garnish (though the lime is a more recent addition). The rum is typically floated on top of the ginger beer, creating a layered effect that resembles a stormy sky.
