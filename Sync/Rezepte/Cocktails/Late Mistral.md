# History
The "Late Mistral" cocktail is a refreshing and sophisticated drink with French origins. Its name and characteristics evoke the "Mistral," a strong, cold, northwesterly wind that blows through the Rhône Valley and Provence in France, suggesting a crisp and invigorating quality.

The cocktail is generally described as a refreshing and sophisticated drink, often characterized by light and floral flavors. It typically offers a citrusy kick that balances out any sweetness, making it a good choice for those who prefer lighter cocktails that are not overly sweet or heavy. It's considered ideal for warm summer evenings or as an elegant option for special occasions. Some variations highlight its subtly aromatic, crisp, and simple yet sophisticated nature.

This particular recipe features Vodka, Ricard (an anise-flavored spirit), cold water, and a Lemon Zest. The inclusion of Ricard, a classic French pastis, directly ties the cocktail to its French origins and provides a distinctive anise note. The combination with vodka and cold water creates a light, refreshing, and aromatic drink, perfect for a warm evening.
