# History
The "Cucumber Greek Yogurt Cocktail" is a modern, creative cocktail that does not have a widely documented historical origin. It is likely a contemporary creation, emerging from the trend of incorporating fresh, savory, and sometimes unexpected ingredients into mixology.

This cocktail is clearly inspired by the flavors of Tzatziki, a traditional Greek yogurt and cucumber dish. Tzatziki itself has a rich history, with the combination of yogurt and cucumber believed to have originated around 1469 CE, used by ancient Greeks for its refreshing and healthy qualities. The word "Tzatziki" is derived from the Turkish word "cacık," which appeared in print as early as 1844, describing yogurt with cucumber and garlic.

The "Cucumber Greek Yogurt Cocktail" takes these traditional flavors and reinterprets them in a sophisticated alcoholic beverage. The use of gin, Cointreau, lemon juice, cucumber simple syrup, and Greek yogurt creates a unique balance of botanical, citrus, and creamy notes, offering a refreshing and intriguing drinking experience. It represents a modern approach to cocktail creation, drawing inspiration from culinary traditions to craft novel flavor profiles.
