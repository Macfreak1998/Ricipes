# History
The "Claridge" cocktail, a classic from the "Golden Age of cocktails," has a rich history and a somewhat debated origin. It is primarily credited to "Leon," a bartender at the Claridge Hotel on the Champs-Elysées in Paris.

The cocktail first appeared in print in Harry MacElhone's 1922 book, *Harry's ABC of Mixing Cocktails*. The recipe was subsequently featured in Harry Craddock's influential 1930 *The Savoy Cocktail Book*.

Despite its name, which often leads to an assumption of a connection with the renowned Claridge's Hotel in London, the cocktail's true origin lies in Paris. There was a theory that Ada Coleman, a celebrated bartender who worked at the Savoy, created the drink during her earlier tenure at Claridge's in London, but this has been disproven by historical records, including MacElhone's book.

The Claridge cocktail is typically made with gin, dry vermouth, apricot brandy (or apricot liqueur), and Cointreau (or triple sec). Its flavor profile is often described as a slightly sweeter and more aromatic variation of a dry Martini, offering a complex interplay of gin, vermouth, and the fruity notes of apricot and orange. While the liqueurs contribute to its sweetness, the drink aims for a sophisticated balance between dryness and fruitiness.
