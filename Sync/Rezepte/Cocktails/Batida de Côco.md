# History
The "Batida de Côco" is a traditional Brazilian coconut cocktail. The name "Batida de Côco" literally translates to "coconut shake" or "shaken coconut" in Portuguese, with "Batida" meaning "shaken" or "beaten," referring to the preparation method of blending the ingredients.

The "Batida" cocktail, in general, is a popular Brazilian drink with origins tracing back to the late 19th or early 20th century. It typically involves cachaça (Brazil's national spirit made from fermented sugarcane juice) blended with fruit juice and sugar. "Batida de Côco" is a specific variation that highlights the rich, creamy essence of coconut. It has become a staple in Brazilian beach culture and has gained international recognition for its tropical flavor.

The primary ingredients for a "Batida de Côco" include coconut milk (or coconut cream), sweetened condensed milk, and cachaça. While cachaça is the traditional spirit, vodka or other white rum can be used as alternatives. The cocktail is known for its creamy texture, sweetness, and tropical taste, often compared to a milkshake.
