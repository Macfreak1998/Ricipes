# History
The "Batida de Maracujá" is a vibrant Brazilian cocktail with a rich tropical heritage, a variation of the traditional Brazilian "Batida." The term "Batida" in Portuguese translates to "beaten" or "shaken," referring to the cocktail's preparation method, where ingredients are typically blended to achieve its characteristic creamy texture. "Maracujá" is the Portuguese word for passion fruit, which is the primary fruit flavor in this specific batida.

Batidas are considered classic Brazilian cocktails, with their origins tracing back to the late 19th or early 20th century. They gained popularity among locals in Brazil, especially in coastal areas, as a way to utilize the country's abundant tropical fruits. The refreshing nature of these drinks made them ideal for Brazil's hot climate.

A traditional batida, including the Batida de Maracujá, typically consists of cachaça (a Brazilian sugarcane spirit) or vodka, fruit juice (passion fruit in this case), and a sweetener like sugar or condensed milk. The ingredients are blended together until smooth. Batidas are a common feature in Brazilian festivals, bars, and restaurants.
