# History
The "Godmother" cocktail is a classic drink with a clear connection to its predecessor, the Godfather. Its history, origin, and meaning are intertwined with the rise of amaretto-based cocktails and popular culture.

The Godmother cocktail originated in the United States in the 1970s. It emerged as a variation of the Godfather cocktail, which traditionally combines Scotch whisky and amaretto. The Godmother simply substitutes vodka for the Scotch whisky, resulting in a smoother, less smoky flavor profile. Both the Godfather and Godmother cocktails were documented in Brian F. Rea's 1976 "Brian's Booze Guide" and Stanley M. Jones' 1977 "Jones' Complete Barguide."

The name "Godmother" is a direct play on the "Godfather" theme. The Godfather cocktail is reputed to have been named after actor Marlon Brando's favorite drink, which he enjoyed while filming "The Godfather" movie. Following this tradition, the Godmother was conceived as a lighter, more refined counterpart, symbolizing a powerful yet graceful female figure. This naming convention reflects the growing Italian-American influence on the bar scene during the 1960s and 70s, coinciding with the popularity of mobster films.

The Godmother cocktail is a simple, two-ingredient drink consisting of vodka and amaretto. The vodka provides a clean base, allowing the sweet, nutty, and almond-like flavors of the amaretto to shine. It is characterized by a smooth, mellow, and spirit-forward taste, offering a balanced and slightly sweet experience without being overly complex. The Godmother cocktail was formerly recognized by the International Bartenders Association (IBA) but was removed from their official list in 2020.
