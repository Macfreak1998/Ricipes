# History
The Waterfront is a modern craft cocktail featured by @theeducatedbarfly (Leandro DiMonriva) with the memorable introduction: "This drink is guaranteed to scare 50% of you and intrigue the other 50% just my kind of tipple! Basically a Fernet Mule, a bartender's best friend!"

**The Fernet Phenomenon:**

The Waterfront is built around Fernet, specifically two types:
- **Fernet Branca**: The iconic Italian amaro made with 27 herbs, roots, and spices including myrrh, rhubarb, chamomile, cardamom, aloe, and saffron. Intensely bitter and medicinal.
- **Fernet Menta**: Fernet Branca's minty cousin, adding peppermint to the herbal base

Fernet Branca has cult status among bartenders—it's traditionally taken as a shot at the end of shifts, considered a "bartender's handshake." This insider status explains why the drink "scares 50% and intrigues the other 50%"—Fernet is polarizing, loved by industry professionals but often too intense for casual drinkers.

**The "Bartender's Best Friend":**

The description as "a bartender's best friend" works on multiple levels:
1. **Digestive Properties**: Fernet is traditionally used as a digestif to settle the stomach
2. **Industry Culture**: Fernet represents bartender camaraderie and shared knowledge
3. **The Mule Format**: Adding ginger beer makes intense Fernet more approachable
4. **Post-Shift Drinking**: Easy to make, refreshing, and helps after a long shift

**The Mule Template:**

By calling it "basically a Fernet Mule," DiMonriva connects this to the familiar Moscow Mule format (spirit + lime + ginger beer). This template makes challenging spirits approachable by adding spicy ginger beer and tart lime. The combination of ginger's warmth with Fernet's bitterness creates surprising harmony.

**Double Fernet:**

Using both Fernet Branca and Fernet Menta (2 oz + 1 oz) creates a drink with serious Fernet character—this isn't for Fernet beginners. The Fernet Menta adds cooling mint that complements the ginger beer's spice, creating layers of herbal, minty, and spicy flavors.

**Why It Works:**

Fernet's intense bitterness and herbal complexity are balanced by:
- **Lime Juice**: Adds tartness and brightness
- **Ginger Beer**: Provides sweetness, spice, and effervescence
- **Mint Garnish**: Reinforces the Fernet Menta's minty character

**Bartender Culture:**

The Waterfront represents bartender drinking culture—bold, uncompromising flavors that industry professionals appreciate but might intimidate civilians. It's the cocktail equivalent of an inside joke: if you "get" Fernet, you'll love this; if you don't, you probably won't.

The drink exemplifies modern craft cocktail culture's embrace of challenging, acquired-taste ingredients. Rather than making drinks that appeal to everyone, bartenders like DiMonriva celebrate drinks that reward adventurous palates and insider knowledge.
