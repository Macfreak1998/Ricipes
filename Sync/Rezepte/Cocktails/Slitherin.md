# History
The "Slitherin" cocktail does not have a long, traditional history like classic cocktails. Instead, it is a modern, themed drink inspired by the Slytherin house from the Harry Potter series. Its "history" is rooted in fan culture and the desire to create beverages that evoke the characteristics and colors of the Hogwarts houses for themed events and gatherings.

Various recipes exist for a Slytherin cocktail, all aiming to capture the house's green aesthetic. This particular recipe, with gin, elderflower liqueur (Holunderblütenlikör), lemon juice, cucumber slices, and soda water, creates a refreshing and visually appealing drink that aligns with the green and sophisticated imagery often associated with Slytherin. The elderflower and cucumber add a fresh, botanical note, while the gin provides a classic base. The cocktail is primarily enjoyed by Harry Potter fans as a way to enhance themed parties, movie nights, and discussions about the wizarding world.
