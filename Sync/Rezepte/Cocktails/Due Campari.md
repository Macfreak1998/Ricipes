# History
The "Due Campari" cocktail is a modern creation that prominently features Campari, an iconic Italian bitter aperitif. While "Due Campari" is not a widely recognized classic cocktail with a distinct historical origin, its name (meaning "Two Campari" in Italian) suggests a drink designed to highlight the versatility and flavor of Campari, often in combination with other ingredients.

**Campari History and Meaning:**
Campari was invented by Gaspare Campari in Novara, Italy, in 1860. He initially called it "Bitter all' uso d'Hollanda" (Dutch bitter). The distinctive red hue of Campari originally came from carmine dye, though the company largely switched to artificial dyes in 2006. Gaspare Campari experimented with distinctive drinks in his caffè, and Campari became his most significant success. His son, Davide Campari, was instrumental in building it into a globally recognized brand.

Campari is an Italian bitter aperitif, characterized by its dark red color and a strong bitter flavor with notes of orange, herbs, and spices. Its secret recipe, a blend of over 60 different spices, herbs, roots, and fruit peels, has remained largely unchanged since its creation. It is considered an aperitif, an alcoholic beverage typically consumed before a meal to stimulate the appetite.

This "Due Campari" cocktail, combining Lemon Juice, Campari Cordial, Campari, and Prosecco or Champagne, is a modern interpretation that showcases Campari's bitter and herbal notes, balanced by citrus and effervescence. The inclusion of "Cordial Campari" (likely a Campari-flavored cordial or a sweeter version) alongside regular Campari further emphasizes the "two Campari" aspect, creating a complex and refreshing aperitif.
