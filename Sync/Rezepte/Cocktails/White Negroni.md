# History
The White Negroni cocktail was created in either 2001 or 2002 by British cocktail expert Wayne Collins. He developed the drink at VinExpo, a beverage trade show held in Bordeaux, France.

Collins' intention was to devise a Negroni variation that retained gin but replaced the traditional Campari and sweet vermouth. He achieved this by substituting Lillet Blanc for the sweet vermouth and Suze, a bittersweet gentian liqueur, for the Campari. This innovative twist on the classic Negroni quickly gained recognition and was subsequently featured in prominent bars worldwide, such as Pegu Club and PDT in New York.

This recipe, with gin, Lillet Blanc, and Suze Gentian Liqueur, is a classic example of this modern and sophisticated twist on the traditional Negroni, offering a lighter, more herbaceous, and less bitter profile.
