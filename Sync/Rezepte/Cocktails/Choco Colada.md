# History
The "Choco Colada" is a modern, chocolate-flavored variation of the classic Piña Colada. While there isn't a distinct historical record for a "Choco Colada" as a separate drink, its origins and meaning are rooted in the well-documented history of the Piña Colada.

The Piña Colada is widely believed to have originated in Puerto Rico. Its creation is most frequently attributed to Ramón "Monchito" Marrero, a bartender at the Caribe Hilton Hotel in San Juan, Puerto Rico, who claims to have created the drink in 1954. He was tasked by the hotel management to create a signature drink that embodied the essence of the tropics. His recipe included white rum, coconut cream, and pineapple juice. The modern Piña Colada gained significant popularity after its creation in the 1950s, and in 1978, Puerto Rico officially declared it its national drink.

The name "Piña Colada" is Spanish and literally translates to "strained pineapple," referring to the freshly pressed and strained pineapple juice used in the drink's preparation. The "Choco Colada" extends this concept by incorporating chocolate, offering a dessert-like, tropical experience.
