# History
The Quarter Deck cocktail is a classic rum-based drink, often considered a member of the Rum Daiquiri family. Its precise origin is somewhat unclear, but it is generally believed to have emerged in the late 19th or early 20th century.

The name "Quarter Deck" has a maritime connection, referring to the raised deck at the stern of a ship, traditionally reserved for officers and captains. This nautical theme is fitting for a rum-based cocktail.

One theory suggests the cocktail was created in the early 1900s by a bartender at the Quarter Deck Bar in New York City. Another perspective points to its possible origin in London during the Prohibition era, given its distinctly British combination of rum, sherry, and lime juice. The cocktail gained recognition and appeared in various cocktail recipe books throughout the 1920s and 1930s. This recipe, with white rum, cream sherry, and lime, aligns with the classic interpretations of this enduring drink.
