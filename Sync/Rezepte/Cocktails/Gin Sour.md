# History
The "Gin Sour" is a classic cocktail with a rich history, originating in the mid-19th century during a period of flourishing cocktail culture. It is believed to be American in origin, with its first mixtures likely occurring in the late 1800s, predating Prohibition in the United States.

The concept of "sour" cocktails, which combine a spirit, citrus, and a sweetener, has roots in the Age of Exploration. Sailors, particularly in the Spanish and British Navies, mixed spirits with citrus juices (like lime) to combat scurvy during long voyages. This practice evolved into drinks like "Grog" and eventually influenced the development of the sour cocktail family. The Gin Sour itself is often considered a variation of the Whiskey Sour. Early versions might have used genever, but the modern Gin Sour solidified with the rise in popularity of London Dry gin.

At its core, the Gin Sour is defined as a mixed drink made with gin, lemon juice, and simple syrup. The "sour" in its name refers to the lemon juice component, but the simple syrup is crucial for balancing the flavors, ensuring the drink is not excessively tart but rather a harmonious blend of sweet, sour, and spirit. It is celebrated for its bright, tangy, and refreshing profile, offering a tart-sweet finish. A common, though optional, modern addition is egg white, which provides a silky texture and a frothy top. The enduring meaning of the Gin Sour lies in its simplicity, adaptability, and its perfect balance of flavors, making it a timeless classic in mixology.
