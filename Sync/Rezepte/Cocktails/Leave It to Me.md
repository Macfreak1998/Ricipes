# History
The "Leave It to Me" cocktail is a classic drink with a history rooted in early 20th-century mixology. Its most well-known origin traces back to Harry Craddock's influential 1930 *The Savoy Cocktail Book*, which features a recipe for the "Leave It to Me Cocktail (No. 1)."

There appear to be at least two distinct versions of the "Leave It to Me" cocktail. This particular recipe, featuring Lemon Juice, Maraschino Liqueur, Dry Vermouth, Gin, and Apricot Liqueur, aligns with the "Leave It to Me Cocktail No. 1." This version typically includes Plymouth Gin, French Vermouth, Apricot Brandy, a dash of lemon juice, and a dash of grenadine.

The meaning behind the name "Leave It to Me" is not definitively documented, but one theory suggests it arose from a common bar interaction. It could have been the bartender's confident reply when a patron, unsure of what to order, said something like, "What are you having?" or "I don't know," implying the bartender would create something delicious. This aligns with the idea of a bartender taking charge and crafting a drink for the customer.
