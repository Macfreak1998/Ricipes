# History
The "Gimlet" cocktail has a rich history rooted in the 19th century aboard ships of the British Royal Navy. It originated as a practical measure to combat scurvy, a disease caused by vitamin C deficiency. To make the highly acidic lime juice more palatable, naval officers began mixing it with their gin rations. This utilitarian practice laid the foundation for the Gimlet. In 1867, Lauchlan Rose patented a method to preserve citrus juice with sugar, leading to the creation of Rose's Lime Juice Cordial, which subsequently became the traditional ingredient for Gimlets.

The first recorded recipe for the Gimlet, specifying equal parts gin and Rose's Lime Juice Cordial, is believed to have appeared in Harry McElhone's "Harry's ABC of Mixing Cocktails" in 1923. The renowned "Savoy Cocktail Book" of 1930 also featured a recipe with a half gin, half Rose's cordial ratio.

The name "Gimlet" has two primary theories regarding its origin:
*   **Sir Thomas Gimlette:** One theory suggests the drink was named after Rear-Admiral Sir Thomas Gimlette (1857-1943), a Royal Navy surgeon, who encouraged officers to mix gin with lime juice.
*   **Piercing Tool:** The more widely accepted theory links the cocktail's name to a "gimlet," a small, screw-tipped tool used for boring holes, reflecting the drink's "lively, piercing style."

The classic Gimlet is a simple yet elegant cocktail, known for its refreshing balance of gin and lime. This recipe offers a modern interpretation using fresh lime juice and simple syrup, alongside the traditional gin, while also noting the historical use of Rose's Lime Cordial.
