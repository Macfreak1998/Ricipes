# History
The Ty Cobbler is a modern cocktail that originated as a "riff" on the classic cobbler style. It was created in 2008 by bartender Phil Ward at the renowned New York City bar, Death & Company. The recipe for the Ty Cobbler was later published in the Death & Company cocktail book in 2014.

The classic cobbler cocktail, which the Ty Cobbler draws inspiration from, has a much longer history, dating back to the 1820s or 1830s. Traditionally, a cobbler cocktail is characterized by a mix of any spirit or wine with sugar, seasonal fruit, an herb, and crushed ice.

The Ty Cobbler, in one notable recipe, includes reposado tequila, Cynar, simple syrup, muddled brandied cherries, and mole bitters. This recipe, with Luxardo cherries, simple syrup, tequila blanco, Cynar, and bitters, aligns with the spirit of Phil Ward's creation, offering a complex and balanced drink that showcases the versatility of tequila and the bitter notes of Cynar within the refreshing cobbler format.
