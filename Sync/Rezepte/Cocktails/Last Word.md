# History
"The Last Word" cocktail originated at the Detroit Athletic Club in the early 1900s, with its presence on a menu confirmed as early as 1916. It gained prominence during the Prohibition era, being served in private clubs and speakeasies. Vaudeville performer Frank Fogarty is often credited with popularizing the drink in New York City.

The cocktail's recipe was later published in Ted Saucier's 1951 cocktail book, "Bottoms Up!". Despite this, it largely fell into obscurity after World War II. Its modern resurgence began in the early 2000s when bartender Murray Stenson rediscovered the recipe in Saucier's book while working at the Zig Zag Cafe in Seattle, leading to its widespread popularity in the craft cocktail movement.

The precise meaning or origin of the name "The Last Word" is not definitively known, and the cocktail's inventor remains "veiled." Theories suggest the name might imply it's the "ultimate" or "perfect" cocktail, leaving nothing more to be said, or that it was created at the last minute before a bar closed during Prohibition.

The Last Word is characterized by its balanced blend of sweet, sour, and herbal flavors, and its distinctive pale green hue. It is typically made with equal parts gin, green Chartreuse, maraschino liqueur, and fresh lime juice. This particular recipe features Gin, Green Chartreuse, Maraschino Liqueur, and Lime Juice, creating a perfectly balanced and herbaceous drink.
