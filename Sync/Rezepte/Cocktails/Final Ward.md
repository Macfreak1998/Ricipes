# History
The Final Ward is a modern craft cocktail created as a whiskey-based variation of the classic Last Word cocktail. While the exact origins are debated, the drink emerged during the early 2000s craft cocktail renaissance and has become a staple in serious cocktail bars worldwide.

The cocktail follows the "equal parts" template popularized by the Last Word (created in Detroit during Prohibition), substituting rye whiskey for gin and lemon juice for lime juice. This simple swap creates an entirely different flavor profile while maintaining the balanced complexity that makes the original so beloved.

The name "Final Ward" is a clever play on "Last Word," suggesting both a continuation and conclusion of the concept. The substitution of rye whiskey brings spicy, robust notes that stand up beautifully to the intense herbal complexity of Green Chartreuse and the nutty sweetness of maraschino liqueur.

The equal-parts structure (0.75 oz of each ingredient) creates a remarkably balanced cocktail despite the bold flavors of each component. The lemon juice provides brightness and acidity that ties everything together, while the rye's spice notes complement rather than compete with the Chartreuse's 130 herbal ingredients.

The Final Ward represents the craft cocktail movement's approach to classic recipes: respectful of tradition while willing to experiment and innovate. The cocktail has spawned numerous variations and has influenced a whole family of equal-parts cocktails.

Like its predecessor, the Final Ward is a powerful, complex sipper that showcases the art of cocktail balance. It's particularly popular among bartenders and cocktail enthusiasts who appreciate its sophisticated interplay of flavors.
