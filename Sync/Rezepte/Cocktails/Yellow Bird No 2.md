# History
The Yellow Bird cocktail is a vibrant, tropical drink with a somewhat mysterious origin, believed to have emerged in the Caribbean, particularly in Jamaica or the Bahamas. It gained popularity in the 1950s and 1960s at resorts and tiki bars.

The exact inspiration for its name is debated. One prominent theory suggests it was named after a popular Haitian folk song titled "Yellow Bird," which gained international recognition through an English rendition in 1957 and a hit recording by Arthur Lyman in 1961. Another theory attributes the name to the drink's bright yellow hue, which comes from the use of Galliano, a golden, herbal Italian liqueur.

The standard recipe for a Yellow Bird cocktail typically includes rum, Galliano, triple sec, and lime juice. This "Yellow Bird No 2" recipe, with lime juice, orange juice, Galliano, white rum, and dark rum, is a variation that incorporates orange juice and dark rum, while omitting triple sec. This creates a slightly different flavor profile, leaning into a more complex rum base and a brighter citrus note from the orange juice, while still retaining the distinctive Galliano character. This recipe is a classic example of a tropical cocktail, celebrated for its vibrant appearance and refreshing, balanced flavors.
