# History
The "Paperplane" cocktail, a modern classic, was created in 2008 by bartender Sam Ross. Ross developed the drink as a favor for a former colleague, Toby Maloney, who needed a summer cocktail for his bar, The Violet Hour.

The name "Paperplane" was inspired by the M.I.A. track "Paper Planes," a song Ross and his colleague Sasha Petraske frequently listened to while developing the drink. Maloney initially misheard the name as "Paper Airplane" when Ross left the recipe on his voicemail.

The cocktail is a whiskey-based drink, often described as a "riff on a Last Word cocktail," another equal-parts drink. Ross's original recipe initially called for Campari, but he later replaced it with Aperol to achieve a less bitter and sweeter profile. He also experimented with various spirits before settling on bourbon as the base.

The Paperplane cocktail consists of equal parts bourbon whiskey, Aperol, Amaro Nonino, and fresh lemon juice. It is typically served straight up in a cocktail glass, though some recommend a lemon twist for garnish. In 2020, the Paperplane was added to the International Bartenders Association's (IBA) list of official cocktails.
