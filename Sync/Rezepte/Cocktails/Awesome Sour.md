# History
The "Awesome Sour" is a modern take on the classic "Sour" cocktail, a category renowned for its refreshing balance of sweet and tart flavors. While "Awesome Sour" itself is not a historically recognized cocktail name, it represents a creative variation within the well-established sour family.

The origins of sour cocktails can be traced back to the 19th century, with roots in the British Navy. To combat scurvy during long voyages, sailors were given rations of lemons and limes, which they often mixed with their rum or brandy to make the spirits more palatable. This practical concoction is considered the direct ancestor of modern sour cocktails. The first official written recipe for a sour cocktail appeared in "The Bartender's Guide" by Jerry Thomas in 1862, which included the Whiskey Sour.

A sour cocktail is defined by a base alcohol, a tart ingredient (typically lemon or lime juice), and a sweet element (usually sugar syrup or a liqueur). This combination creates a balanced and refreshing drink. This "Awesome Sour" recipe, as presented by the "How to Drink" YouTube channel, is a whiskey sour with the addition of an egg white for a creamy texture and a red wine float, adding a layer of complexity and visual appeal to the classic formula.
