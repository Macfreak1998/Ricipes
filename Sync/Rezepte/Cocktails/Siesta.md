# History

The Siesta cocktail was invented by bartender Katie Stipe in 2006 at the Flatiron Lounge in New York City. This modern classic emerged during a period when tequila cocktails, beyond the ubiquitous Margarita and Tequila Sunrise, were not widely prevalent.



Stipe's creation is a unique twist on the Hemingway Daiquiri, belonging to the sour family of cocktails. She ingeniously replaced the rum base of the Hemingway Daiquiri with blanco tequila and swapped the maraschino liqueur for a dash of Campari. The Siesta's core ingredients include blanco tequila, fresh lime juice, grapefruit juice, simple syrup, and Campari, which imparts a distinctive bitter note and a characteristic blush pink hue.



The cocktail's popularity grew steadily, initially spreading through word-of-mouth among New York City bartenders. Its recognition as a modern classic was further cemented when it was featured in the Speed Rack cocktail competition. This recipe, with tequila blanco, lime juice, simple syrup, grapefruit juice, Campari, and Angostura bitters, is a classic example of this modern and innovative cocktail.
