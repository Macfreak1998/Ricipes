# History
The Army & Navy is a classic pre-Prohibition cocktail that first appeared in print in Harry Craddock's iconic 1930 "Savoy Cocktail Book," though it likely existed earlier. The drink represents the gin-based sour family of cocktails that dominated American and British bar culture in the early 20th century.

As featured by Instagram bartender @theeducatedbarfly (Leandro DiMonriva), this cocktail "remains one of my absolute favorites to this day. This is the cocktail that made me fall in love with gin." The Educated Barfly is one of YouTube and Instagram's most respected cocktail educators, known for historical accuracy and precise technique.

**The Name:**

The "Army & Navy" name likely references the friendly rivalry between military branches, though no definitive origin story exists. The name appears during a period when many cocktails bore patriotic or military names (Artillery Punch, Artillery Cocktail, etc.), possibly reflecting the era's social climate.

**Classic Formula:**

The Army & Navy is essentially a gin sour sweetened with orgeat (almond syrup) instead of simple syrup. This substitution transforms the drink:
- **Orgeat**: Adds nutty, marzipan-like sweetness and creates a silky, slightly creamy texture
- **Gin**: Botanical complexity pairs beautifully with almond flavors
- **Lemon**: Brightens the rich orgeat and gin combination
- **Angostura bitters**: Adds spice and complexity, tying the elements together

**The Saline Solution:**

The Educated Barfly's version includes 5 drops of 20% saline solution—a modern technique that wasn't part of the original recipe. Salt enhances flavor perception, reduces bitterness, and rounds out the drink's overall profile. This small addition demonstrates how classic recipes can be improved with contemporary understanding of flavor science.

**Modern Revival:**

The Army & Navy experienced a renaissance in the 2010s-2020s as part of the broader craft cocktail movement's rediscovery of pre-Prohibition classics. Its simple elegance and unique orgeat sweetness make it a favorite among bartenders seeking alternatives to standard gin sours.

The drink's balance and sophistication exemplify why classic cocktail recipes remain relevant—proper ratios and quality ingredients create timeless appeal.
