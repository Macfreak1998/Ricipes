# History
The "Kill Devil cocktail" is a modern classic with a name rooted in the historical origins of rum.

The "Kill Devil cocktail" was created in 2008 by Erin Williams at the Pegu Club in New York City, USA.

The term "Kill Devil" itself is an old nickname for rum, dating back to the 17th century. Richard Ligon, who fled to Barbados in 1647, described "kill-devil" in 1657 as "the drink of the Island," made from the skimmings of sugar-boiling coppers. This potent drink, derived from the by-product of sugar production, was believed to cause severe hangovers, leading to its evocative name. Some theories suggest the name implied the drink was strong enough to "kill the devil" or was used to subdue enslaved people. The term was widely used for this fermented sugar cane spirit before "rum" became the more common name.

The modern "Kill Devil cocktail" typically includes Rhum Agricole (or Agricole White Rum, as in this recipe), Green Chartreuse, demerara syrup (or simple syrup), and Angostura bitters. A distinctive garnish for this cocktail is a flaming lime "lily pad," where a small amount of overproof rum is ignited on a lime peel, which caramelizes the lime's essential oils and enhances the drink's aroma and flavor. This cocktail offers a complex and aromatic profile, blending the grassy notes of rhum agricole with the herbal complexity of Green Chartreuse and the bitterness of Angostura.
