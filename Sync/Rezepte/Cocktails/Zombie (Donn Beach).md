# History
The Zombie cocktail was invented in 1934 by Donn Beach (born Ernest Raymond Beaumont-Gantt) at his Hollywood restaurant, Don the Beachcomber. Beach is widely recognized as the pioneer of Tiki cocktail culture. The drink gained further popularity on the East Coast after its appearance at the 1939 New York World's Fair.

The meaning behind the cocktail's name stems from a legendary incident. Donn Beach reportedly created the potent concoction for a hungover customer who needed to attend a business meeting. The customer later returned, claiming that the drink had made him feel like a "zombie" throughout his entire trip. The Zombie cocktail is known for its deceptive nature; its smooth, fruity flavor effectively conceals its very high alcohol content, which Beach himself noted could make someone feel "like the walking dead." Due to its potency, Don the Beachcomber restaurants famously limited customers to only two Zombies per person.
