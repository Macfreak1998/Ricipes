# History
The "Smash" cocktail first appeared in the mid-1840s and gained popularity in the 1850s, with the Brandy Smash being a favored version. It was considered a more straightforward drink than the Mint Julep. Bartender Jerry Thomas included it in his 1862 Bartender's Guide, calling it a "Julep on a small placcordingly." Harry Johnson later distinguished it as a separate cocktail category in 1888. Its popularity declined after the 1860s.

The term "Smash" may come from "smasher," an American slang term from 1842 for something exceptional, possibly referring to the drink's impact or the aggressive muddling technique. It's closely related to the Mint Julep, differing in that the Smash involved muddling and shaking mint, while the Julep typically stirred it, and the Smash lacked the Julep's ornate presentation.

The modern interpretation of the Smash is largely attributed to bartender Dale DeGroff in the late 1990s, who revitalized the Whiskey Smash by incorporating muddled lemon. Today, the "Modern Smash" is a flexible style of drink featuring muddled fresh fruit (often seasonal), mint or other herbs, a spirit, and sugar, served over crushed ice. This adaptability makes it popular in contemporary cocktail culture.
