# History
The Sloppy Joe cocktail is intrinsically linked to the famous Sloppy Joe's Bar in Havana, Cuba, which was a popular establishment in the 1930s. The bar was opened by José Abeal Otero sometime between 1917 and 1919. Otero was nicknamed "Sloppy Joe" by his regulars, and he eventually renamed his bar to Sloppy Joe's.

During the Prohibition era in the United States, Sloppy Joe's Bar became a hotspot for American travelers seeking a lively escape with music, gambling, and Cuban flair. Ernest Hemingway was a frequent patron of the Havana bar, and it even inspired the fictitious Freddy's Bar in his novel *To Have and Have Not*.

While there are at least two vintage cocktails that bear the name "Sloppy Joe" or are associated with Sloppy Joe's, the recipe in this file, with lime juice, triple sec, grenadine, dry vermouth, and white rum, aligns with the general style of cocktails served at such establishments during that era. These drinks often featured rum, citrus, and liqueurs, reflecting the tropical influences and the tastes of the American expatriates and tourists. This particular combination offers a refreshing and balanced drink, characteristic of the vibrant cocktail scene of pre-Castro Havana.
