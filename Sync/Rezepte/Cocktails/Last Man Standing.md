# History
The "Last Man Standing" cocktail, as presented in this recipe, is a bold and bitter drink, often considered a variation of the classic Negroni. While the name "Last Man Standing" is applied to various cocktails, this particular rendition is featured as a nightcap in Brad Thomas Parsons' book "Last Call."

Its origin stems from the question of whether a Negroni with fernet would be a successful combination. The cocktail delivers intense notes of orange peel and herbs, with Campari and fernet fiercely competing for dominance. The meaning of this drink is rooted in its challenging and strong flavor profile, often described as a "palate buster" for those who appreciate bitter tastes, and it's considered a "bartender's drink" due to its simple, equal-parts recipe and contentious ingredients. Benjamin Hash of the Horse Inn of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, crafted this particular recipe, describing it as a "burly badass" shot-turned-cocktail that "forces contemplation, a moment of clarity."

This recipe features Whiskey, Gin, Fernet Branca, and Campari, creating a complex and potent spirit-forward drink that balances the bitterness of Campari and Fernet Branca with the botanical notes of gin and the warmth of whiskey.
