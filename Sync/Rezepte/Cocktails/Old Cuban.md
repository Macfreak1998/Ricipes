# History
The "Old Cuban" cocktail is a modern classic, celebrated for its sophisticated blend of aged rum, fresh mint, lime juice, simple syrup, bitters, and champagne. It was created in 2001 by renowned mixologist Audrey Saunders at the Pegu Club in New York City. Initially, it was called "El Cubano."

Saunders meticulously developed the recipe, aiming to marry the richness of aged rum with the refinement of champagne, drawing inspiration from Cuba's golden era of cocktail culture. The "Old" in its name specifically refers to the aged rum, a crucial component that imparts depth and character to the drink.

The Old Cuban is more than just a cocktail; it's considered a celebration of Cuban culture and its profound influence on mixology. It pays homage to classic Cuban flavors, particularly through the use of aged rum, mint, and lime, reminiscent of the Mojito. The addition of champagne introduces a touch of French elegance, echoing the French 75. The drink embodies sophistication with a pop of effervescence, making it an ideal choice for those who appreciate a well-crafted and balanced drink. Its allure lies in its ability to create a layered experience where the rum, bitters, and champagne harmonize perfectly, offering a refreshing yet complex profile.
