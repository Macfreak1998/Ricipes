# History
The Batanga is a legendary Mexican cocktail created in 1961 by Don Javier Delgado Corona, the owner and bartender of La Capilla (The Chapel) in Tequila, Jalisco, Mexico. This unassuming bar in the heart of tequila country became a pilgrimage site for tequila lovers, largely due to Don Javier's charisma and his signature drink.

Don Javier named the cocktail "Batanga" after one of his customers who was notably stout in appearance—the word roughly translates to "chubby" or "potbellied" in local slang. Despite the unflattering name origin, the drink became an icon.

What makes the Batanga special isn't just the simple combination of tequila, fresh lime juice, and Coca-Cola (similar to a Cuba Libre but with tequila instead of rum). It's Don Javier's distinctive preparation ritual: he famously stirred every Batanga with the same knife he used to cut the limes. This knife-stirring technique became the signature of an authentic Batanga, and Don Javier continued this ritual well into his eighties until his passing in 2020 at age 96.

The salted rim distinguishes the Batanga from a simple tequila and Coke. The salt enhances the lime's tartness and balances the sweetness of the cola, creating a more complex flavor profile. The combination of sweet cola, tart lime, salt, and quality tequila creates a surprisingly sophisticated drink despite its humble ingredients.

La Capilla became so famous that visitors from around the world would make the pilgrimage to Tequila just to have Don Javier make them a Batanga. He became a local legend, known for his warmth, his dancing, and his insistence on quality tequila (never the cheap stuff).

The cocktail went absolutely viral on TikTok in 2024-2025, introducing a new generation to this classic Mexican serve. What was once a regional specialty known mainly to tequila enthusiasts became a global phenomenon, with bartenders worldwide paying homage to Don Javier's simple but perfect creation.

**Traditional serving note**: Purists insist the Batanga must be stirred with a knife, not a spoon or straw, to honor Don Javier's original method. Some say the knife adds subtle metallic notes that enhance the drink—though this is likely more ritual than reality.

The Batanga proves that great cocktails don't need to be complicated. With just three main ingredients and a salted rim, Don Javier created a drink that has endured for over 60 years and continues to delight drinkers around the world.
