# History
The "Ancient Mariner" cocktail is a tiki drink created by Jeff "Beachbum" Berry and Annene Kaye. It first appeared in their 1998 drink guide, *Beachbum Berry's Grog Log*.

Jeff Berry developed the Ancient Mariner in 1994 as his attempt to recreate the flavors of Trader Vic's Navy Grog, which itself was a take on Don the Beachcomber's earlier version. Berry, a renowned tiki historian and owner of Latitude 29 in New Orleans, dedicated significant effort to documenting and preserving tiki culture and its lost recipes. His research into Trader Vic's Navy Grog led him to a pamphlet with vague ingredients, prompting him to reconstruct the drink by taste through much trial and error.

The cocktail is named after Samuel Taylor Coleridge's 1798 poem, "The Rime of the Ancient Mariner." However, the name's meaning, in Berry's words, refers to the extensive and challenging process of perfecting the drink: "by the time we finished with it, that's how old we felt." A signature ingredient of the Ancient Mariner is pimento-flavored liqueur, commonly known as "pimento dram" or "allspice dram."
