# History
The "Reconstructed Surfer on Acid" is a modern and refined take on the popular "Surfer on Acid" shot. The original "Surfer on Acid" cocktail was created in the 1990s by Los Angeles bartender Eric Tecosky, while he was working at a club on Sunset Boulevard.

The original shot is known for its combination of Jägermeister, coconut rum, and pineapple juice. It quickly gained popularity as a party shot due to its unique flavor profile and catchy name.

The "Reconstructed Surfer on Acid" aims to elevate this popular shot into a more sophisticated cocktail. This version often incorporates higher-quality ingredients, such as Plantation Pineapple Rum and Orgeat (almond syrup), to create a more balanced and complex drink. It retains the core flavors of the original but presents them in a more refined and enjoyable format, moving it from a quick shot to a sippable cocktail.
