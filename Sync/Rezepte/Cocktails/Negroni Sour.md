# History
The Negroni Sour is a modern hybrid cocktail created by Instagram bartender @speakeasieruk (based in Liverpool, UK). The drink brilliantly combines two classic cocktail templates: the Negroni (gin, Campari, sweet vermouth) and the Whiskey Sour (spirit, lemon, sugar, egg white).

The creator's introduction reveals the drink's purpose: "If you love a Negroni but want a slightly lighter serve this is your bet! It's beautiful. Simple syrup can push it on the sweeter side of balanced so if you're averse to sweeter serves drop that to 5ml or omit it all together and you'll be in a good place!"

**The Hybrid Concept:**

Creating cocktail hybrids by combining two classic templates is a popular modern bartending approach. The Negroni Sour takes:

**From the Negroni:**
- Gin (botanical base)
- Campari (bitter complexity)
- Sweet Vermouth (herbal sweetness)

**From the Sour:**
- Lemon juice (acidity and brightness)
- Simple syrup (balancing sweetness)
- Egg white (silky texture and foam)

**Why It Works:**

The addition of lemon juice and egg white transforms the Negroni's dense, spirit-forward character into something lighter and more approachable. The egg white's foam softens Campari's aggressive bitterness, while lemon juice adds brightness that traditional Negronis lack.

The creator specifically notes this is for people who love Negronis but want "a slightly lighter serve"—perfect for those who find classic Negronis too intense or boozy but still crave that distinctive Campari-vermouth complexity.

**Sweetness Calibration:**

The recipe notes carefully address sweetness, acknowledging that 15ml (0.5 oz) simple syrup "can push it on the sweeter side." The suggestion to reduce to 5ml or omit entirely shows sophisticated understanding of how different palates prefer different sweetness levels. Without added simple syrup, the sweet vermouth alone provides sufficient sweetness for those who prefer drier drinks.

**Visual Appeal:**

Like all proper sours with egg white, this creates a beautiful white foam cap that contrasts with the drink's pink-red base (from Campari). Bartenders can add aromatic bitters to create patterns on the foam surface, enhancing visual presentation.

The Negroni Sour exemplifies modern cocktail creativity: respectfully adapting classics while maintaining their essential character, creating something familiar yet distinctly new.
