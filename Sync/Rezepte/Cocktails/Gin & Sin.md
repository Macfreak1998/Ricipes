# History
The "Gin & Sin" cocktail is a vintage drink that originated in the 1920s during the Prohibition era in the United States. Its precise creator and exact place of origin remain unknown.

The cocktail emerged as a creative solution to mask the harsh taste of poorly made, bootlegged spirits prevalent during Prohibition, with gin being one of the most accessible liquors at the time. It traditionally combines gin with citrus juices, specifically orange and lemon, and grenadine.

The name "Gin & Sin" is believed to reflect the moral tensions of the Prohibition era, juxtaposing the indulgence of drinking ("sin") with the societal push for temperance. Another interpretation suggests the "sin" could refer to the perceived overindulgence in the sweet and tart fruit flavors compared to other classic cocktails. Additionally, some sources propose that the name alludes to the act of drinking itself during a time when it was illegal, or the ease with which one could consume a significant amount of gin due to the cocktail's fruity profile.
