# History
The "Black Manhattan" cocktail was created by bartender Todd Smith in San Francisco in 2005. He developed the drink at another establishment before introducing it to the renowned Bourbon & Branch bar.

The name "Black Manhattan" refers to its distinct characteristics compared to a classic Manhattaccordingly. The key difference lies in the substitution of Amaro, a bittersweet Italian liqueur, for the sweet vermouth typically used in a Manhattaccordingly. This change results in a darker color and a more complex, less sweet flavor profile, often featuring earthy, herbal, or even chocolatey notes, and a drier finish.
