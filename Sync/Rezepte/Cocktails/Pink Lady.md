# History
The "Pink Lady" is a classic gin-based cocktail with a long and somewhat debated history, known for its distinctive pink hue derived from grenadine.

**History and Origin:**
The exact origin of the Pink Lady cocktail is not definitively known. Several theories exist:
*   **Broadway Musical Connection:** One popular theory suggests the cocktail was named after the 1911 Broadway musical "The Pink Lady" by Ivan Caryll, or in honor of its star, Hazel Dawn, who was known as "The Pink Lady." Hazel Dawn herself reportedly told a drinks historian that the cocktail was created for her on the play's opening night, though that early version differed from what is known today.
*   **Jacques Straub:** An early version of the drink, consisting of gin, apple brandy (or applejack), citrus, and grenadine, was published by Jacques Straub in 1913.
*   **Prohibition Era:** The cocktail was already widely known during the Prohibition era (1920–1933). Its popularity during this time may have stemmed from its ability to mask the taste of the often poor-quality gin available.

**Meaning and Perception:**
By the 1930s, the Pink Lady began to acquire an image as a "female" or "girly" drink, largely due to its name, sweet and creamy flavor, and delicate pink color. This perception was reinforced by publications like Esquire's Handbook for Hosts (1949) and later by Jack Townsend's 1951 "The Bartender's Book," which described the typical Pink Lady drinker as a timid womaccordingly. This "girly" reputation led to the cocktail falling out of favor with many male cocktail critics. Despite its soft appearance, the Pink Lady is a well-balanced and potent drink. Today, the Pink Lady is experiencing a resurgence and is once again recognized as a classic cocktail.

**Key Ingredients:**
While recipes vary, the core ingredients that define the Pink Lady cocktail typically include gin, grenadine (which gives it its characteristic pink color), and egg white (to create a frothy, silky texture). Common additions often include lemon juice and applejack (apple brandy). This particular recipe features Gin, Applejack, Lemon Juice, Grenadine, and Egg White, creating a rich, frothy, and fruity gin-based drink.
