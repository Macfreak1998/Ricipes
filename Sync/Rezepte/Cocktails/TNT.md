# History
The "TNT cocktail" refers to at least two distinct drinks with different origins. The original TNT cocktail dates back to the Prohibition era in the United States, likely enjoyed in speakeasies during the 1920s. This version is a two-ingredient drink, typically made with rye whiskey and pastis, though absinthe was also used. Its simple yet distinct blend of spicy, smoky, fruity, and herbal flavors made it a popular choice during a time of "spirited rebellion" and clandestine revelry.

Rye whiskey itself has a history dating back to 1750, predating bourbon. Pastis emerged after absinthe, a popular 19th-century French spirit, was prohibited in many countries at the start of the 20th century.

A separate cocktail also known as TNT stands for "Tequila N' Tonic." This simpler recipe combines tequila, tonic, and lime.

This recipe, with bourbon and Pernod, aligns with the Prohibition-era version, substituting bourbon for rye whiskey and using Pernod as the anise-flavored component. It offers a strong, spirit-forward drink with a distinct herbal note from the Pernod, characteristic of the original TNT cocktail.
