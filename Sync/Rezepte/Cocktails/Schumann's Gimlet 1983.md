# History
The "Schumann's Gimlet" is a variation of the classic Gimlet cocktail, created in 1983 by the renowned German bartender and author Charles Schumann of Munich. This particular recipe was featured in his 1995 publication, the *American Bar book*.

Schumann's version distinguishes itself from the traditional Gimlet by incorporating fresh lemon juice in addition to lime cordial, aiming for a fresh citrus sourness to balance the richness of the lime cordial. The classic Gimlet typically consists of gin and lime cordial, with some modern interpretations using fresh lime juice.

This recipe, with gin, lemon juice, and lime juice, is a direct representation of Schumann's 1983 creation, offering a balanced and refreshing take on the classic Gimlet.
