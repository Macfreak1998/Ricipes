# History
The Rattlesnake cocktail's history traces back to Harry Craddock's 1930 publication, *The Savoy Cocktail Book*. Craddock himself provided a memorable, if humorous, explanation for its name, stating it was "So-called because it will either cure Rattlesnake bite, or kill Rattlesnakes, or make you see them."

At its core, the Rattlesnake is a variation of a whiskey sour, characterized by the inclusion of absinthe and egg white. This places it within the "improved" cocktail category, a term used for classic cocktails enhanced with additional ingredients.

Despite its early appearance, the cocktail did not immediately achieve widespread fame, partly due to the extensive number of recipes in *The Savoy Cocktail Book* and the prohibition of absinthe in the early 20th century. However, the reintroduction of absinthe to the American market around 2007 sparked renewed interest in forgotten absinthe-based drinks. Modern interpretations have further contributed to the Rattlesnake cocktail's contemporary popularity. This recipe, with bourbon, lemon juice, simple syrup, egg white, and a dash of Pernod (an absinthe substitute), aligns with the classic structure of this intriguing cocktail.
