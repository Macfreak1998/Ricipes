Schumann's version

# History
The "Piña Colada Schumann" is a unique interpretation of the classic "Piña Colada," a popular cocktail made with rum, cream of coconut, and pineapple juice. This particular rendition is noted as "Schumann's version," suggesting a specific interpretation by a renowned bartender or establishment.

The name "Piña Colada" is Spanish for "strained pineapple," referring to the fresh, strained pineapple juice used in its preparation. The origin of the Piña Colada is a subject of debate, with several individuals and establishments claiming its invention, all rooted in Puerto Rico.
*   **Folk Origins:** An early tale suggests that in the 19th century, Puerto Rican pirate Roberto Cofresí served his crew a beverage containing coconut, pineapple, and white rum.
*   **Modern Creation Claims:** The most frequently credited creator of the modern Piña Colada is Ramón "Monchito" Marrero, who claimed to have invented the drink on August 15, 1954, while working as a bartender at the Caribe Hilton Hotel's Beachcomber Bar in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Ricardo Garcia, another bartender at the Caribe Hilton, also claims to have invented the drink in 1953. Ramón Portas Mingot, a Spanish bartender at the Barrachina Restaurant in Old San Juan, claims to have created the Piña Colada in 1963.

Despite the conflicting claims, Puerto Rico officially declared the Piña Colada its national drink in 1978. The drink gained further international popularity after Rupert Holmes released "Escape" (the "Piña Colada Song") in 1979.

This "Piña Colada Schumann" recipe features Heavy Cream, Coconut Cream, Pineapple Juice, Dark Rum, and White Rum. It is a rich and creamy variation that combines the traditional elements of a Piña Colada with a blend of dark and white rums, creating a complex and flavorful tropical drink. The inclusion of both heavy cream and coconut cream contributes to its luxurious texture.
