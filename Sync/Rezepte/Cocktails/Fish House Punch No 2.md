# History
"Fish House Punch" is a historic and potent alcoholic beverage with a rich history rooted in colonial America. It is widely believed to have originated in 1732 at the Schuylkill Fishing Company of Pennsylvania, an exclusive gentlemen's club near Philadelphia, also known as the "State in Schuylkill" or simply the "fish house."

The "fish house" served as a gathering place for its members, who engaged in activities like fishing, eating, and drinking. The earliest written account of a similar lemon punch dates back to 1744. Notable figures such as George Washington and Marquis de Lafayette were known to have enjoyed this punch. The recipe for Fish House Punch was later documented in influential works like Jerry Thomas's 1862 "Bar-Tender's Guide."

"Fish House Punch" refers to a strong, rum-based punch. Its typical ingredients include rum, cognac, peach brandy (or peach liqueur), lemon juice, sugar, and water. Traditionally, it is prepared in a large punch bowl, served over a substantial ice block, and garnished with lemon slices. Due to its potency, it is sometimes diluted with cold lemonade, black tea, or seltzer water. It is recognized as one of the oldest clubhouse cocktails in the United States and holds a significant place in American cocktail history.

This particular recipe, "Fish House Punch No 2," is a version from Schumann's, featuring water, black tea, honey, simple syrup, dark rum, brandy, and lime. It is a variation that allows for sweetening to taste and can be served hot or cold, offering a unique take on this historical punch.
