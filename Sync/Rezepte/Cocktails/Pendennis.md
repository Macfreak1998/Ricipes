# History
The Pendennis cocktail was created in 1911 at the Pendennis Club in Louisville, Kentucky, one of America's most prestigious private social clubs. The club, founded in 1881, was known as a gathering place for Louisville's social elite and has been credited with creating or popularizing several classic cocktails.

The original 1911 recipe featured a simple but elegant combination of gin and apricot brandy with lime juice in a 2:1 ratio. The drink showcases the early 20th-century American preference for fruit-forward cocktails with a sophisticated balance.

Later variations, particularly a 1939 version, added Peychaud's bitters for additional complexity, though the original recipe remains the most widely recognized version. The cocktail represents the golden age of American club culture and pre-Prohibition cocktail craftsmanship.

The Pendennis Club is also famously associated with the Old Fashioned cocktail, though the exact origins of that drink remain disputed. The club continues to operate today and maintains its reputation for cocktail excellence.

The Pendennis cocktail exemplifies the classic American "fancy drink" tradition - spirit-forward but approachable, with bright citrus notes and stone fruit complexity from the apricot liqueur.
