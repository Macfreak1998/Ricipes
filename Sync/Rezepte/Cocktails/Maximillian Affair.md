# History
The "Maximillian Affair cocktail" was created around 2008 by Boston-based bartender Misty Kalkofen, initially at Green Street in Cambridge, MA.

The cocktail's name is a historical reference to the French intervention in Mexico during the 1860s. During this period, Napoleon III installed Archduke Maximilian of Austria as the Emperor of Mexico. This venture ended with Maximilian's capture and execution in 1867.

The meaning behind the cocktail's composition is symbolic, blending French and Mexican elements to reflect this historical event. It combines Mexican mezcal with French St-Germain elderflower liqueur, along with Punt e Mes (a sweet vermouth) and lemon juice. The cocktail is often noted for being a more harmonious blend of these elements than the historical affair it commemorates.
