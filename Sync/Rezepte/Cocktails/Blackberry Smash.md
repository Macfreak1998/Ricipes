# History
The "Blackberry Smash" is a refreshing cocktail belonging to the "smash" family of drinks, characterized by muddled fruit and herbaceous notes. Its origins can be traced back to the early 20th century, a period when similar fruit-forward cocktails gained popularity in American bars.

The concept of a "smash" cocktail itself has been around for over a century, with its roots potentially predating the original Golden Age of Cocktails in the 1840s. The first known published recipe for a smash appeared in Jerry Thomas's 1862 book, *How to Mix Drinks: Or, A Bon-vivant's Companion*, where he described it as "simply a Julep on a small placcordingly." This highlights the close relationship between smashes and juleps. By 1888, barman Harry Johnson directly addressed the smash as a separate cocktail from a julep. The basic elements of a smash cocktail consistently include a spirit base, ice (often crushed), a sweetener (sugar or syrup), an herb (typically mint), and seasonal fruit, with muddling being a crucial step to release the flavors.

The "meaning" of the Blackberry Smash lies in its vibrant and refreshing character. It balances the sweetness of blackberries with the tartness of lemon juice and the warmth of whiskey, often complemented by fresh mint. It embodies a "farm-to-bar" philosophy by utilizing fresh, seasonal ingredients, making it a popular choice for summer sipping. The drink is appreciated for its harmonious blend of fruity, herbal, and boozy flavors, resulting in a smooth and satisfying finish.
