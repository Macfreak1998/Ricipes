# History

The Twelve Mile Limit cocktail originated during the Prohibition Era and is attributed to writer and war correspondent Tommy Millard. Its name directly references the changing regulations regarding the enforcement of Prohibition in US territorial waters.



Initially, US jurisdiction for enforcing alcohol laws extended only three nautical miles offshore. This led many to venture beyond this "Three Mile Limit" to consume alcohol legally. As these offshore gatherings became more prevalent, the US government considered, and later negotiated, extending this enforcement boundary to twelve miles.



The Twelve Mile Limit cocktail was conceived as a response to this extended limit, often described as a more potent version of its "Three Mile Limit" predecessor, symbolizing the increased distance one had to travel to find a legal drink. The cocktail typically features a blend of light rum, rye whiskey, brandy, grenadine, and lemon juice. This recipe, with white rum, rye whiskey, brandy, grenadine, and lemon juice, is a classic example of this historically significant cocktail.
