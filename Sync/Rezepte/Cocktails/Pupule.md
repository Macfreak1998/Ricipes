# History
The "Pupule" cocktail is a classic Tiki drink with a rich history, originating from the legendary Don the Beachcomber in the 1930s. The name "Pupule" itself means "crazy" in Hawaiiaccordingly. This cocktail is also known by another name, "Nui Nui," which it was later given. Its recipe has been preserved and popularized in books like Beachbum Berry's Sippin' Safari and the *Smuggler's Cove* book. Despite its "crazy" name, the drink is often described as surprisingly refined, offering bright citrus flavors that evolve into complex spices.

The name "Pupule" is derived from Polynesian mythology. It refers to spirits that protect sacred places. In Easter Island words, "Aku Aku" can mean "spiritual guide." One interpretation also describes an "Aku Aku" as a "ghost that walks," specifically a "demon ghost" that can manifest as either male or female. The name also gained prominence from Thor Heyerdahl's 1957 book, "Aku-Aku: the Secret of Easter Island," which detailed his archaeological expedition to Easter Island.
