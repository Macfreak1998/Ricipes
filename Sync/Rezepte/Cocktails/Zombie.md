# History
The Zombie cocktail, a potent and iconic tiki drink, was invented in 1934 by Ernest Raymond Beaumont-Gantt, better known as Donn Beach, at his Hollywood restaurant, "Don the Beachcomber." Donn Beach is widely recognized as the "founding father" of tiki culture, pioneering the exotic, Polynesian-themed bar experience.

The history of the Zombie cocktail is steeped in secrecy. Donn Beach meticulously guarded his recipes, using coded instructions and numerically labeled bottles to prevent competitors and even his own staff from learning the exact ingredients. This secrecy contributed to the drink's mystique and popularity. The original recipe was complex, featuring a blend of three different rums, various fruit juices, liqueurs, and other components like falernum, Angostura bitters, Pernod, grenadine, and a special "Donn's Mix" of grapefruit juice and cinnamon syrup. Due to its exceptionally high alcohol content, "Don the Beachcomber" establishments famously limited customers to only two Zombies per visit. Decades later, tiki historian Jeff "Beach Bum" Berry successfully decoded and published Beach's original recipe.

The meaning behind the name "Zombie" comes from a legendary anecdote. Donn Beach reportedly created the drink for a hung-over customer who needed to attend a business meeting. The customer later returned, claiming the drink had made him feel like a "zombie" for the duration of his trip or meeting. Beach himself noted that the cocktail's potency could make one feel "like the walking dead," as its smooth, fruity flavor effectively masked its significant alcoholic strength. This recipe, with its complex blend of rums, juices, and liqueurs, is a classic representation of Donn Beach's original creation.
