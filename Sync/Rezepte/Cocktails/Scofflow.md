# History

The Scofflaw cocktail originated in 1924 at Harry's New York Bar in Paris, France. Its name is directly linked to the Prohibition era in the United States. In 1924, a contest was held to coin a term for individuals who flouted the laws against alcohol consumption; the winning entry was "scofflaw," intended to stigmatize these lawbreakers.



However, rather than shaming drinkers, the term was embraced by bartenders, particularly those American bartenders who had moved to Paris due to Prohibition. The creation of the Scofflaw cocktail was a clever way for Parisians to mock American Prohibition laws and became a symbol of defiance against the ban on alcohol.



The classic recipe for a Scofflaw cocktail typically includes rye whiskey, dry vermouth, lemon juice (though some variations use lime juice), grenadine, and a dash of orange bitters. This combination resulted in a balanced and refined drink, making it one of the enduring contributions to cocktail culture from the Prohibition period. This recipe, with rye whiskey, dry vermouth, lemon juice, grenadine, and orange bitters, aligns with the classic proportions of this historically significant cocktail.
