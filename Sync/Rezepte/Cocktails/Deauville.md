# History
The "Deauville" cocktail is a classic drink believed to have originated before Prohibition, with its first written appearance in Harry Craddock's 1930 *The Savoy Cocktail Book*. It is thought to have been inspired by the Sidecar cocktail.

The cocktail is named after Deauville, a chic seaside town in Normandy, France. This naming is a nod to the region, as Calvados, a key ingredient in the cocktail, is an apple brandy produced in Normandy.

The Deauville cocktail is an elegant blend of Calvados, cognac (or brandy), Cointreau (a triple sec), and lemon juice. While the original recipe in *The Savoy Cocktail Book* did not include simple syrup, it is often added in modern recipes to balance the tartness of the lemon juice. The flavor profile is complex, combining the apple notes of Calvados with the warmth of cognac, the citrusy brightness of Cointreau, and the refreshing acidity of lemon juice.
