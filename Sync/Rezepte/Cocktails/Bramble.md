# History
The "Bramble" cocktail is a modern classic with a clear history and origin, created in the mid-1980s by bartender Dick Bradsell at Fred's Club in Soho, London, England. Bradsell, often referred to as the "Godfather of Modern British Cocktails," also invented other well-known drinks like the Espresso Martini.

The inspiration for the Bramble came from Bradsell's childhood memories of picking blackberries on the Isle of Wight. The name "Bramble" directly refers to the bush on which blackberries grow. Bradsell aimed to create a truly British drink, though he noted the irony of using French crème de mûre and non-native lemons.

The cocktail is essentially a gin sour with blackberry liqueur. Its simplicity and balance of gin, lemon, sugar, and crème de mûre are key to its success. The crème de mûre is typically poured over crushed ice at the end, creating a "bleeding" effect that is visually appealing. The use of crushed ice is considered crucial for the drink's dilution and mouthfeel.
