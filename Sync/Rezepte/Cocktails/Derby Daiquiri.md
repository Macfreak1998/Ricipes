# History
The "Derby Daiquiri" is a specific variation of the classic Daiquiri cocktail, notable for its origin and association with the Florida Derby.

The Derby Daiquiri was created in 1958 by legendary mixologist Mariano Licudine at The Mai-Kai restaurant in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. It was officially introduced in 1959 as the signature drink for the Florida Derby, aiming to provide that race with an iconic cocktail similar to the Kentucky Derby's Mint Julep. The creation was also tied to a Rums of Puerto Rico cocktail contest, and The Mai-Kai, a significant consumer of Puerto Rican rum, used brands like Don Q or Bacardi in the drink. The cocktail gained significant publicity, being championed in national ad campaigns by Rums of Puerto Rico and featured as Esquire magazine's "drink of the month."

The "Derby" in Derby Daiquiri directly refers to its connection with the Florida Derby horse race. It is characterized as a light, frosty orange Daiquiri, often described as sweeter and less tart than the classic version. Historically, it was sometimes served in a unique 6-ounce jockey glass to commemorate its racing association.

The original Daiquiri cocktail, from which the Derby Daiquiri derives, is widely believed to have been invented in 1898 by American mining engineer Jennings Cox near the town of Daiquirí, Cuba. He reportedly improvised the drink with rum, lime, and sugar when he ran out of gin for his guests. The Daiquiri was later refined and popularized in Havana, particularly by Constantino Ribalaigua Vert at El Floridita bar, who is credited with developing the modern and frozen versions of the cocktail.
