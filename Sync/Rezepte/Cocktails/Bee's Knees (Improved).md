# History
The "Bee's Knees" cocktail originated during the Prohibition era in the United States in the 1920s. Its exact creation is debated, with some attributing it to Frank Meier, a bartender at the Hotel Ritz in Paris, while others suggest it might have been invented by American socialite Margaret Brown, also known as "the Unsinkable Molly Brown."

The primary purpose of the lemon juice and honey in the cocktail was to mask the unpleasant taste of the poor-quality "bathtub gin" that was common during Prohibition.

The name "Bee's Knees" itself was a popular slang term during the 1920s, signifying "the best" or "excellent." The cocktail, typically made with gin, fresh lemon juice, and honey, was considered to live up to its name.

This particular recipe is an "improved" version of the classic Bee's Knees cocktail, as described by the "How to Drink" YouTube channel, likely aiming to refine the balance or enhance certain flavors of the original.
