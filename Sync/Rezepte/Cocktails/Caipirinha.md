# History
The "Caipirinha," Brazil's national cocktail, boasts a rich history with several theories surrounding its origin and a name deeply rooted in Brazilian culture. It is traditionally made with cachaça (a Brazilian spirit distilled from fermented sugarcane juice), fresh lime, sugar, and ice.

One of the most widely accepted theories suggests the Caipirinha originated around 1918 in Brazil as a medicinal remedy for the Spanish flu pandemic. The initial concoction reportedly included cachaça, lime, garlic, and honey to alleviate symptoms. Over time, the garlic and honey were replaced with sugar and ice, leading to the classic cocktail known today. Another theory posits that the drink was showcased at elite 19th-century parties in São Paulo by wealthy farmers eager to display their local agricultural produce, particularly sugarcane. There's also folklore suggesting Queen Carlota Joaquina of Portugal invented it by mixing cachaça with fruit and sugar.

The name "Caipirinha" is derived from the Portuguese word "caipira," which refers to people from rural areas in Brazil, and can be roughly translated as "little redneck."

From its humble beginnings as a potential medicinal tonic, the Caipirinha evolved into a popular social drink by the 1930s. It gained international recognition and was officially declared Brazil's national cocktail by the Brazilian government in 2003. Today, the Caipirinha is more than just an alcoholic beverage; it is a significant symbol of Brazilian culture, history, and identity, reflecting the country's vibrant spirit and rich traditions.
