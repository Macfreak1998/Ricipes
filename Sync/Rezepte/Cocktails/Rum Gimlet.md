# History
The history of the Rum Gimlet cocktail is closely tied to the British Royal Navy's efforts to combat scurvy and the evolution of the Gin Gimlet. In the 18th century, scurvy was a major problem for sailors, and citrus fruits were found to be effective in preventing it. To ensure sailors consumed their daily dose of vitamin C, the British Navy began issuing lime juice, which was often preserved with rum and mixed into the sailors' daily rum ration, creating a drink known as "grog." This can be seen as the direct ancestor of the Rum Gimlet, a practical concoction born out of necessity.

In 1867, Lachlan Rose patented a method to preserve lime juice with sugar, creating Rose's Lime Cordial, which became a staple on naval ships. While naval officers typically had access to gin and began mixing it with Rose's Lime Cordial, leading to the creation of the Gin Gimlet, the historical precedent of sailors mixing rum and lime juice for decades meant that a "Rum Gimlet" was a natural and logical variation. It essentially formalized the "grog" concept into a cocktail, substituting rum for gin in the established Gimlet recipe. This recipe, with white rum, lemon juice, and lime juice, is a classic example of this refreshing and historically significant cocktail.
