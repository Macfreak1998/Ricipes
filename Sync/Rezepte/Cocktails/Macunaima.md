# History
The "Macunaíma cocktail," a uniquely Brazilian drink, was created in 2014 by bartender Arnaldo Hirai at the Boca de Ouro bar in São Paulo, Brazil.

Its name is a direct reference to the protagonist of Mário de Andrade's influential 1928 novel, "Macunaíma." The literary character is an anti-hero who embodies the diverse and often contradictory aspects of Brazilian identity, journeying from the Amazon to São Paulo. Similarly, the cocktail is designed to reflect this Brazilian essence, being described as bold, layered, and complex.

The drink itself is a blend of cachaça (a Brazilian spirit), Fernet (an Italian bitter liqueur popular in Brazil), fresh lime juice, and simple syrup, resulting in a balanced profile of bitterness and citrus. This combination of local and international ingredients further symbolizes the cultural fusion represented by its namesake.
