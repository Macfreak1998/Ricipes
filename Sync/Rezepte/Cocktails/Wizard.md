# History

The "Wizard cocktail" does not refer to a single, universally recognized drink with a long historical lineage. Instead, it refers to a few distinct recipes and a broader theme in mixology, often linked to the wizarding world or fantasy.



This particular recipe, with gin, apricot liqueur, lime juice, passion fruit syrup, and Sprite, suggests a fruity and refreshing drink. It is likely a modern creation, possibly inspired by the broader "wizard" theme, but without a specific historical origin. The combination of gin and fruit flavors, topped with a sparkling soda, creates a light and enchanting beverage, perfect for those seeking a magical and refreshing experience. It's a testament to the creativity in modern cocktail crafting, where names and ingredients can evoke a sense of wonder and fantasy.
