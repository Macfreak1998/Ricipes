# History

The Sidecar cocktail, a classic blend of cognac, orange liqueur (such as Cointreau or Triple Sec), and lemon juice, emerged around the end of World War I in either London or Paris, becoming popular in the early 1920s. Its exact origin remains somewhat debated, with several theories and individuals credited with its invention.



One prominent theory suggests the Sidecar was created at the Ritz Hotel in Paris. The story goes that a regular customer, an American army captain, would arrive at the bar in the sidecar of a motorcycle. He desired a pre-dinner drink to warm him, and the bartender, Frank Meier, mixed brandy with curacao, lemon juice, and ice, naming the drink after the captain's mode of transport.



Another theory attributes the Sidecar to Pat MacGarry, a bartender at Buck's Club in London, around 1919. Harry MacElhone, a well-known bartender who later owned Harry's New York Bar in Paris, cited MacGarry as the inventor in early editions of his book, "Harry's ABC of Mixing Cocktails."



The first confirmed recipes for the Sidecar appeared in print in 1922 in Robert Vermeire's "Cocktails" and Harry MacElhone's "Harry's ABC of Mixing Cocktails." The drink is considered a "daisy cocktail" or a variation of a sour, with orange liqueur acting as the sweetener instead of simple syrup. This recipe, with cognac, Cointreau, and lemon juice, is a classic example of this enduring and sophisticated cocktail.
