# History
The Spiced Pear Collins is a contemporary, autumnal twist on the classic Tom Collins cocktail. While the exact origin of every Spiced Pear Collins variation isn't definitively documented, its roots lie in the long and somewhat debated history of the Tom Collins.

The classic Tom Collins cocktail has a contested past, with theories linking its origin to John Collins, a headwaiter at Limmer's Old House in London around the 1860s, or to an elaborate practical joke in New York in 1874. Regardless of its precise origin, the first recorded recipe for a Tom Collins appeared in Jerry Thomas's "The Bartender's Guide" in 1876. The traditional Tom Collins is a simple, refreshing mix of gin, lemon juice, sugar (or gum syrup), and soda water.

The Spiced Pear Collins takes this classic structure and infuses it with seasonal flavors. It's designed to be a warming, sophisticated drink for cooler weather. One notable creation of the Spiced Pear Collins is attributed to Nikki Achitoff-Gray, a food writer and recipe developer. These modern interpretations typically incorporate pear in various forms, such as pear liqueur or pear juice, along with warming spices. This recipe, with gin, St. George Spiced Pear Liqueur, pear juice, ginger snap syrup, and lemon juice, is a classic example of this modern and flavorful variation.
