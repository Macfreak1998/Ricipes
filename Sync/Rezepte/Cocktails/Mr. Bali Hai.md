# History
The "Mr. Bali Hai" cocktail is an iconic tiki drink with a rich history rooted in mid-20th-century Polynesian pop culture.

The Mr. Bali Hai cocktail originated at the Bali Hai Restaurant, which opened in 1955 (some sources cite 1953 or 1954) on Shelter Island in San Diego, California. It quickly became the restaurant's signature drink, designed to embody the venue's tropical ambiance with a strong, slightly sweet, and exotically flavored profile.

The cocktail and the restaurant itself are likely named after the song "Bali Ha'i" from the 1949 musical *South Pacific*, which evokes a mystical tropical island. Tom Ham, the restaurant's founder, also stated that "Bali Hai" means "Your own special island." The drink is specifically named after the carved wooden "Mr. Bali Hai" statue that prominently stands at the restaurant's entrance and was also featured on the restaurant's signage and as a distinctive tiki mug.

The Mr. Bali Hai cocktail is notable for its unique flavor profile, which sets it apart from many other tiki drinks. Unlike most, it incorporates coffee liqueur (or coffee-infused brandy in earlier recipes), providing a distinctive rich, roasted character. The drink typically features a blend of rums (often dark Jamaican and light rums), pineapple juice, and lemon juice, balanced with sweeteners like falernum or simple syrup. It is traditionally served over crushed ice in a tiki mug, often one modeled after the "Mr. Bali Hai" headhunter statue.
