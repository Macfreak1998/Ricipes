# History
The Tequila Sour is a modern interpretation of the classic "sour" cocktail family, which has roots dating back to the 1800s with drinks like the Whiskey Sour. While its precise origin is debated, some sources suggest it gained popularity in Mexico, while others point to California during the "Golden Age of Cocktails."

This cocktail distinguishes itself from other tequila-based drinks, such as the Margarita, by emphasizing the complexity of tequila with a balanced blend of sweet and sour flavors. It has become a staple in high-end bars and mixology circles globally.

A traditional Tequila Sour typically consists of tequila (often 100% agave Blanco or Reposado), fresh lemon juice, and simple syrup (or agave nectar). Some recipes also include an egg white, which creates its signature frothy foam through a "dry shake" method. This recipe, with tequila blanco, lemon juice, simple syrup, and a cherry garnish, is a classic example of this refreshing and balanced cocktail.
