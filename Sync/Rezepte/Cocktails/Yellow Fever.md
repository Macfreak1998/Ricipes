# History
There is no specific historical information linking the "Yellow Fever cocktail" to the year 1982. The origin of the cocktail is generally considered uncertain, with some beliefs suggesting it was created as an elixir to protect against the actual yellow fever disease.

The cocktail typically consists of ingredients such as vodka, Galliano, pineapple juice, and lemon or lime juice. The "1982" in the categories might indicate a specific publication or popularization date for this particular recipe, rather than its creation.

This recipe, with pineapple juice, lemon juice, Galliano, and vodka, aligns with the typical ingredients mentioned for the Yellow Fever cocktail. It offers a vibrant and fruity flavor profile, balancing the sweetness of pineapple with the tartness of lemon and the herbal notes of Galliano, all underpinned by vodka. The name itself, "Yellow Fever," likely alludes to the cocktail's color and perhaps a playful nod to its potential "curative" or invigorating effects.
