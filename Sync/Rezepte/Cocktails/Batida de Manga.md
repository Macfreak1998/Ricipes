# History
The "Batida de Manga" is a Brazilian cocktail with a rich tropical heritage, a variation of the traditional Brazilian "Batida." The term "Batida" originates from the Portuguese word "bater," meaning "to shake" or "to mix," referring to the way the drink is prepared.

Traditional Batidas typically feature cachaça (a spirit distilled from fermented sugarcane juice, similar to rum), fresh fruit juice, and sugar. The "Batida de Manga" specifically incorporates mango, a popular tropical fruit, into this classic Brazilian cocktail style. Batidas are widely enjoyed in Brazil and other Latin American countries, often embodying the festive spirit of Brazilian celebrations.
