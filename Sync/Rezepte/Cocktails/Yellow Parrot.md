# History
The Yellow Parrot cocktail is a classic drink with a history dating back to the early 20th century. Its first known appearance in print was in Robert Vermeire's 1922 book, "Cocktails: How to Mix Them," where it was described as a "Boston drink." The cocktail also notably featured in Harry Craddock's influential 1930 "The Savoy Cocktail Book."

The recipe for the Yellow Parrot consistently calls for equal parts of absinthe, yellow Chartreuse, and apricot brandy or liqueur. Early recipes suggested shaking the ingredients, but modern interpretations often prefer stirring to achieve optimal dilution. The name "Yellow Parrot" might be linked to a 19th-century French expression where drinking absinthe was described as "strangling the parrot," a colorful metaphor for the potent effects of the spirit.

This recipe, with Yellow Chartreuse, Apricot Liqueur, and Pernod (an anise-flavored liqueur often used as a substitute for absinthe), aligns with the classic ingredients. It offers a complex and herbaceous flavor profile, balancing the sweetness of apricot with the unique notes of Chartreuse and the anise character of Pernod, creating a sophisticated and historically significant cocktail.
