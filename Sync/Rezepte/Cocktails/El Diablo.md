# History
The "El Diablo" cocktail, whose name translates to "the devil" in Spanish, has a somewhat debated origin but is generally recognized as one of the earliest tequila-based cocktails.

One popular account suggests the El Diablo cocktail originated in the 1940s in Tijuana, Mexico, credited to Don Javier Delgado Corona, who owned a bar there. American tourists are believed to have discovered the drink and introduced it north of the border.

However, another prominent theory attributes its widespread introduction to Victor Bergeron, famously known as Trader Vic. The cocktail first appeared as "Mexican El Diablo" in his 1946 publication, "Trader Vic's Book of Food and Drink." Bergeron subsequently featured it on his tiki bar menus in 1947 and later at his Mexican-themed restaurant chain, Señor Pico, in the 1960s. Some speculate that Bergeron might have drawn inspiration from a rum-based cocktail also named "Diablo."

Despite its evocative name, the El Diablo cocktail is often described as a "mild affair" rather than being exceptionally alcoholic or sharp. The name is thought to be more of a "statement" or a "cracking name" that aligned with Trader Vic's brand and the "tiki culture" he helped popularize. The use of tequila as a base likely influenced the Spanish name, and the reddish hue imparted by the crème de cassis could also contribute to the "devilish" imagery.

The traditional El Diablo cocktail is made with tequila (often reposado), crème de cassis, fresh lime juice, and topped with ginger ale or ginger beer. This particular recipe features Reposado Tequila, Lime Juice, Crème de Cassis, Simple Syrup, Angostura Bitters, and Ginger Beer, offering a balanced blend of sweet, spicy, and fruity notes.
