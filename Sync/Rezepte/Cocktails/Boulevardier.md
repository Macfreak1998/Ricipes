# History
The "Boulevardier" cocktail originated in Paris in the late 1920s and is attributed to Erskine Gwynne, an American writer and socialite. Gwynne founded a monthly magazine in Paris called "Boulevardier," and the cocktail was named after his publication. The term "Boulevardier" itself loosely translates from French to mean "a wealthy, fashionable socialite," "a frequenter of boulevards," or "a man about town."

The cocktail first appeared in print in Harry McElhone's 1927 Parisian cocktail book, *Barflies and Cocktails*. McElhone, the proprietor of Harry's New York Bar in Paris, credited Gwynne with the drink.

The Boulevardier is composed of whiskey (typically bourbon or rye), sweet vermouth, and Campari. It is often described as a variation of the Negroni, with whiskey replacing the gin, and is believed to predate the Negroni. After being largely forgotten for about 80 years, the Boulevardier experienced a resurgence in popularity in the late 2000s as part of the craft cocktail movement and became an IBA official cocktail in 2020.
