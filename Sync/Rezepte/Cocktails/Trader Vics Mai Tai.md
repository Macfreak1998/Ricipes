# History
The Trader Vic's Mai Tai cocktail has a rich history, with its origins attributed to Victor Jules Bergeron, famously known as Trader Vic. He claimed to have invented the drink in 1944 at his restaurant in Oakland, California.

The original Mai Tai recipe, as crafted by Trader Vic, consisted of a 17-year-old Jamaican J. Wray & Nephew rum, fresh lime juice, Holland DeKuyper Orange Curaçao, a dash of rock candy syrup, and French Orgeat syrup. The cocktail's name is said to have come from a Tahitian phrase, "Mai Tai – Roa Ae," meaning "Out of this world – The Best," exclaimed by his friends from Tahiti, Eastham and Carrie Guild, upon tasting the new concoction.

However, the Mai Tai's origin is not without controversy. Donn Beach, of Don the Beachcomber, also claimed to have created a similar drink called the Q.B. Cooler in 1933, leading to a long-standing debate between the two tiki pioneers. Despite the differing claims and recipes, Trader Vic's version ultimately gained widespread recognition as the Mai Tai.

The cocktail's popularity expanded significantly when Trader Vic introduced it to Hawaii in 1953. Over time, the Mai Tai recipe evolved due to the scarcity of the original 17-year-old rum, leading to adjustments that included blends of Jamaican and Martinique rums. This recipe, with Rhum Agricole, Jamaican rum, dry curaçao, lime juice, orgeat, and simple syrup, aligns with the classic Trader Vic's Mai Tai.
