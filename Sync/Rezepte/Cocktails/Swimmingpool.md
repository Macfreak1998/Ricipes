# History
The "Swimmingpool" cocktail, also known as the "Swimming Pool," was created in 1979 by the renowned German bartender Charles Schumann. He created the drink at his Schumann's Bar in Munich, Germany. The recipe was later published in his 1984 book "Schumann's Barbuch" and a refined version appeared in his 1991 book "American Bar."

This creamy, sweet, and tropical cocktail is characterized by its distinctive blue color, achieved with blue curaçao, which gives it the appearance of a swimming pool. Its ingredients typically include white rum, vodka, coconut cream, pineapple juice, and blue curaçao. The cocktail is often considered a variation of the Piña Colada, with the addition of vodka and blue curaçao. This recipe, with vodka, white rum, pineapple juice, heavy cream, coconut cream, and blue curaçao, is a classic example of this popular tropical cocktail.
