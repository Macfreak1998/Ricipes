# History
The "King's Breakfast cocktail" is a modern mixology creation by Steve the Bartender, drawing inspiration from the classic Breakfast Martini and Sasha Petraske's Cosmonaut cocktail.

The name "King's Breakfast" carries historical significance, referencing the fact that Rosolio, a key component of Italicus (a liqueur used in the cocktail), was once the primary aperitivo enjoyed by the King of Savoia in Italy.

This cocktail is characterized by its bright, tart, jammy, floral, and fresh profile, making it a popular choice for brunch. Its typical ingredients include gin, Italicus Rosolio di Bergamotto, fresh lemon juice, and strawberry jam. This particular recipe features Italicus, Gin, Lemon Juice, and Strawberry Jam, creating a vibrant and flavorful drink.
