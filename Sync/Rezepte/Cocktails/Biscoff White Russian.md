# History
The Biscoff White Russian is a modern twist on the classic White Russian cocktail. The original White Russian, a simple yet iconic drink made with vodka, coffee liqueur, and cream, has a history that dates back to the mid-20th century.

The story begins with the Black Russian (vodka and coffee liqueur), which was first created in 1949 in Brussels for the American ambassador to Luxembourg. The White Russian emerged sometime in the 1950s or 60s with the addition of cream. The cocktail gained massive popularity after being featured as the signature drink of "The Dude" in the 1998 film *The Big Lebowski*.

The Biscoff White Russian is a recent innovation that incorporates the popular Biscoff spread (a spiced cookie butter) into the classic recipe. This adds a sweet and spicy flavor to the creamy cocktail, creating a new and indulgent variation.
