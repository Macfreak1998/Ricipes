# History
The Gin and Tonic is a classic highball cocktail with a history that is deeply rooted in the British Empire. The drink was invented in the 19th century by British soldiers stationed in India as a way to make their daily dose of quinine more palatable.

Quinine, which is found in the bark of the cinchona tree, was the only effective treatment for malaria at the time, but it has a very bitter taste. To mask the bitterness, the soldiers would mix the quinine with water, sugar, lime, and gin. This mixture not only helped to prevent and treat malaria, but it also created a refreshing and enjoyable drink.

The first written record of a Gin and Tonic appeared in 1868, and the drink quickly became popular throughout the British Empire. Today, tonic water contains much less quinine than it did in the 19th century, but the Gin and Tonic remains one of the most popular and enduring cocktails in the world. Winston Churchill once famously remarked that "The gin and tonic has saved more Englishmen's lives, and minds, than all the doctors in the Empire."
