# History
The "Deep-Sea Diver" cocktail has a rich history rooted in the golden age of tiki drinks, evolving from earlier creations by the legendary Don the Beachcomber.

The Deep-Sea Diver cocktail traces its origins back to the 1930s, stemming from tropical drink pioneer Don the Beachcomber's original cocktail menu. It evolved from his earlier creations, specifically the "Pearl Diver's Punch" and "Pearl Diver" cocktails. When the Mai-Kai restaurant opened in 1956, its founding mixologist, Mariano Licudine, tweaked these secret recipes, often elevating them. The "Pearl Diver" was thus "graduated" and renamed the "Deep Sea Diver," becoming a staple on the Mai-Kai's menu.

The name "Deep-Sea Diver" is evocative, suggesting an exploration of profound and intricate flavors. The cocktail is described as "rich and creamy," offering a superb blend for those wishing to "explore the depths" of its taste. Furthermore, the drink is known for its considerable potency, often featuring multiple types of rum, including high-proof varieties, which contributes to the "deep" aspect of its character. The name also serves as a nod to its predecessor, the "Pearl Diver," maintaining a thematic connection to underwater exploration.
