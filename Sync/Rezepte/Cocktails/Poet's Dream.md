# History
The Poet's Dream cocktail first appeared in the 1935 *Old Waldorf Astoria Bar Book*. Its precise inspiration remains unknown, but cocktail historian David Wondrich has suggested an American origin for the drink, possibly named after the poet Wallace Stevens.

The cocktail evolved through different recipes. The original version called for equal parts gin, dry vermouth, and Bénédictine. A new recipe in the 1937 *Café Royal Cocktail Book* adopted a format more akin to a classic martini, including orange bitters and adjusted ingredient ratios. Later adaptations, such as one in the *Esquire Handbook*, emphasized the sweet, honeyed, and herbal characteristics of Bénédictine, often resulting in a lower alcohol by volume drink. This recipe, with gin, dry vermouth, Bénédictine, and orange bitters, aligns with the later, more refined versions of this classic cocktail.
