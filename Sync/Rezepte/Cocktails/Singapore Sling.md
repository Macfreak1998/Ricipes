# History
The Singapore Sling is a gin-based cocktail with a rich and somewhat debated history, widely recognized as originating in Singapore. The drink is generally reputed to have been created in 1915 by Ngiam Tong Boon, a bartender at the Long Bar in the Raffles Hotel in Singapore. Initially, it was known as a "gin sling."

A key motivation behind its creation was the social etiquette of the time. It was considered inappropriate for women to consume alcohol openly in public. Ngiam Tong Boon ingeniously crafted the Singapore Sling to resemble a fruit juice, with a pink hue, allowing women to enjoy an alcoholic beverage discreetly.

While the Raffles Hotel is strongly associated with the drink's origin and popularization, some cocktail historians suggest that similar gin slings existed in Singapore prior to 1915 and that the drink's connection to the Raffles Hotel might have solidified in the 1920s.

The exact original recipe of the Singapore Sling is a subject of debate, as it was reportedly lost after the 1930s when the hotel temporarily stopped serving it. Over the decades, various recipes have emerged, and the version commonly known today, often featuring gin, cherry liqueur, Cointreau, Bénédictine, pineapple juice, lime juice, grenadine, and Angostura bitters, is believed to be a reformulation from the 1970s. This recipe, with gin, Cherry Heering, Benedictine, Cointreau, lime juice, grenadine, pineapple juice, Angostura bitters, and soda water, aligns with the classic and popular version of this iconic cocktail.
