# History
The "Midori Sour" is a vibrant green cocktail with a history rooted in Japanese innovation and American disco culture. Its name directly reflects its key components: "Midori," which is Japanese for green, referring to the melon liqueur, and "Sour," indicating the tart citrus juices that balance the drink's sweetness.

The story of the Midori Sour begins with the Midori melon liqueur itself. Developed in Japan by Shinjiro Torii in the 1960s, the liqueur was inspired by the flavors of Japanese muskmelons and yubari fruit. Initially launched as Hermes Melon Liqueur in 1964, it was later renamed Midori.

Midori made its grand debut in the United States in 1978 at the iconic Studio 54 nightclub in New York City during a movie launch party. Its bright green color and fruity flavor quickly made it a popular choice, embodying the fun and vibrant atmosphere of the 1970s disco era. The Midori Sour, typically made with Midori, vodka, fresh lemon and lime juices, and topped with club soda, became the cocktail that cemented Midori's household name status.

While the cocktail enjoyed significant popularity throughout the 1980s and 90s, it saw a decline in favor during the craft cocktail movement. However, it has recently experienced a resurgence, with bartenders finding new ways to incorporate its distinctive melon flavor. This particular recipe features Midori, Lime Juice, and Egg White, creating a frothy and balanced sour that highlights the melon liqueur.
