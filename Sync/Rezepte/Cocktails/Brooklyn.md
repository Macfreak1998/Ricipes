# History
The Brooklyn cocktail first appeared in print in Jacob A. Grohusko's "Jack's Manual" in 1908, making it a true pre-Prohibition classic from New York's cocktail golden age.

Originally created as a variation on the Manhattan, the Brooklyn substitutes Amer Picon (a French bitter orange liqueur) for the bitters and adds maraschino liqueur for complexity. The drink represents the sophisticated cocktail culture of early 20th-century New York.

Since Amer Picon is difficult to find in many markets, modern versions often substitute Italian amari like Ramazzotti or Montenegro, sometimes with added orange bitters to replicate the original's citrus notes. The cocktail's balance of whiskey, sweet vermouth, and bitter elements creates a more complex and nuanced drink than its Manhattan cousin.

The Brooklyn has experienced a revival in craft cocktail bars, appreciated for its sophisticated balance and historical significance.

Note: Original recipe called for Amer Picon. Common substitutes: Amaro Ramazzotti, Amaro Montenegro, or Bigallet China China Amer.
