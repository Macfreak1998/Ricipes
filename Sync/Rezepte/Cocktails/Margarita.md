# History
The "Margarita" cocktail is a popular drink with a rich, albeit mysterious, history. Its name, "Margarita," is Spanish for "daisy."

**Meaning and Composition:**
A Margarita is defined as a cocktail primarily composed of tequila, a liqueur (often triple sec), and lime juice. It is frequently served with a salt rim on the glass. This cocktail belongs to the "sour" family of drinks, characterized by a balance of sweet, salty, and bitter flavors. The International Bartenders Association (IBA) suggests a standard ratio of 10 parts tequila, 4 parts triple sec, and 3 parts fresh lime juice.

**Origin and History:**
The precise origin of the Margarita is debated, with numerous stories and legends surrounding its creation. It is widely believed to have originated in the US/Mexico border regions sometime between the 1930s and early 1950s. Cocktail historians often suggest that the Margarita evolved from the "Daisy" cocktail, with tequila replacing brandy as the base spirit.

Several popular origin stories include:
*   **Danny Negrete:** A bartender who reportedly created the drink in 1936 as a wedding gift for his sister-in-law, Margarita.
*   **Carlos Herrera:** Another bartender credited with inventing the cocktail in 1938 for a patron who was particular about her tequila drinks.
*   **Margarita Sames:** A socialite who, in the 1940s, is said to have mixed tequila, Cointreau, and lime juice at her Acapulco vacation home, with guests naming the drink after her.
*   **Santos Cruz:** The head bartender at the Balinese Room in Galveston, Texas, who allegedly created the drink for singer Peggy Lee in 1948, naming it after the Spanish version of her name.
*   **Don Carlos Orozco:** A bartender at Hussong's Cantina in Ensenada, Baja California, who supposedly named a new drink after a frequent customer, Margarita Henkel Cesena, in 1941.

The first known printed recipe for a Margarita appeared in Esquire magazine in 1953. The cocktail's popularity significantly increased in the 1970s with the introduction of the frozen Margarita. Today, it remains one of the most popular and recognizable cocktails globally.
