# History
The Tropical Coffee Margarita was invented at the Maybe Sammy bar in Sydney, Australia. This cocktail is a unique fusion that combines tropical and coffee elements with the classic margarita. It features Tequila Blanco, coffee liqueur, mango syrup, and lime juice, creating a harmonious balance of tropical sweetness and rich coffee notes. The drink is celebrated for its creativity and complex taste.

The broader concept of a "Coffee Margarita" takes inspiration from the espresso martini, exploring the combination of coffee and tequila. Coffee liqueur, particularly, has been noted to pair well with tropical flavors like pineapple, mango, and passion fruit, making the inclusion of coffee and mango in a margarita an interesting and successful combination. This recipe, with tequila blanco, coffee liqueur, mango syrup, and fresh lime juice, is a classic example of this modern and innovative cocktail.
