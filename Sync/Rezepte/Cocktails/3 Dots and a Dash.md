# History
The "Three Dots and a Dash" cocktail is a classic Tiki drink with a rich history and symbolic meaning, created during World War II by the legendary Donn Beach (Ernest Raymond Beaumont Gantt), often credited as the "godfather of Tiki."

The cocktail was invented towards the end of World War II as a celebratory toast to the Allied victory. Donn Beach, known for his Polynesian-themed bars and tropical cocktails, devised this drink as an ode to hope, resilience, and peace. His bars became iconic for transporting patrons into a tropical sanctuary, offering an escape from the stresses of everyday life, especially during wartime. The original recipe was later unearthed and revitalized by Beachbum Berry in his book "Sippin' Safari."

The name "Three Dots and a Dash" directly refers to the Morse code for the letter "V" (· · · —), which stood for "Victory" for the Allies against the Axis powers. This symbol of resistance and victory was popularized during the war, notably by Winston Churchill. The cocktail's garnish visually represents its name and meaning, typically featuring three maraschino cherries on a pick, symbolizing the "three dots," and a pineapple chunk or frond, representing the "dash." This thoughtful detail ties together the drink's name and its historic roots.
