# History
"The Dockside: A Killer Rum Old Fashioned Cocktail" is a modern creation, not a historical cocktail with a long lineage. Its development was inspired by two main factors: the creator's personal quest to visit top bars globally and the Dead Rabbit bar's effort to recreate the extinct "London dockside rum" style.

The broader "Old Fashioned" cocktail, from which "The Dockside" draws its inspiration, has a much longer history. It originated in the early 1800s as a "whiskey cocktail," defined by its simple components: spirits, bitters, water, and sugar. The name "Old Fashioned" came about in the 1870s and 1880s when patrons, preferring the original, less embellished version, would specifically ask for an "old-fashioned whiskey cocktail."

The Rum Old Fashioned, a variation that substitutes rum for whiskey, is believed to have originated in the Caribbean or Latin America, regions where rum is a prominent spirit. This particular recipe, with gold rum, dark rum, Jamaican rum, crème de cacao white, simple syrup, Orinoco bitters, and Bitterman's Mole Bitters, is a complex and modern take on the Rum Old Fashioned, designed to evoke the rich flavors and history of dockside rum.
