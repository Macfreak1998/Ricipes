# History
The "Stormy Weather" cocktail, as a distinct historical entity, is not as widely documented as its close relative, the "Dark 'n' Stormy," which is traditionally made with dark rum and ginger beer. The term "Stormy Weather" often refers to variations of the classic Dark 'n' Stormy or similar dark rum and ginger beer concoctions.

However, the recipe presented here, with Fernet Branca, dry vermouth, and crème de menthe white, is completely different from the typical "Stormy Weather" or "Dark 'n' Stormy" variations. This suggests that this specific "Stormy Weather" recipe is likely a unique creation or a local variation, rather than a historically established cocktail.

The combination of bitter Fernet Branca, herbaceous dry vermouth, and refreshing crème de menthe creates a complex and intriguing flavor profile. It's a bold and unusual mix that likely appeals to those seeking a unique and adventurous drinking experience. Given its distinct ingredients, its origins are probably modern and specific to the creator or establishment where it was developed, showcasing an innovative blend of flavors outside of the traditional cocktail canon.
