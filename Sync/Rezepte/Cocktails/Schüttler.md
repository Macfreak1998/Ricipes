# History
The "Schüttler" is not a traditional cocktail with a widely documented historical origin. Instead, it appears to be a modern, informal, and unique way of consuming a drink, particularly popular in social settings. The name "Schüttler" is German for "shaker" or "trembler," and it likely refers to the act of mixing the two components—Blue Curacao and Lemon Juice—directly in the mouth.

This method of consumption, where two separate shots are simultaneously drunk and mixed in the mouth, creates an immediate and intense flavor experience. The combination of sweet and citrusy Blue Curacao with tart lemon juice results in a vibrant and refreshing taste. The optional stronger variant, incorporating vodka, further enhances its potency.

Given its unconventional preparation and lack of historical records, the "Schüttler" is best understood as a contemporary party shot or a playful experiment in mixology, rather than a classic cocktail with a long lineage. Its origins are likely informal and tied to modern drinking culture.
