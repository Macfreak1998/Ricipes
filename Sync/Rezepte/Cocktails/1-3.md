# History
The "1-3" cocktail appears to be a unique or obscure recipe, as there is no widely documented historical information about a cocktail with this specific name. It is likely a personal creation or a local specialty, rather than a classic cocktail with a long-established history.

The combination of Aperol, Absinthe, Lemon Juice, and Grenadine suggests a modern and creative approach to mixology. Aperol, a bitter Italian aperitif, gained significant popularity in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, particularly with the rise of the Aperol Spritz. Absinthe, with its strong anise flavor, has a rich history but its use in cocktails often points to more experimental or contemporary recipes.

Given these ingredients, the "1-3" cocktail offers a complex flavor profile that balances bitterness, herbal notes, citrus, and sweetness. Its origins are likely modern and specific to the creator or establishment where it was developed, showcasing an innovative blend of flavors outside of the traditional cocktail canon.
