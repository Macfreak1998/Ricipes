# History
The "Godfather" cocktail is a classic two-ingredient drink made with Scotch whisky and amaretto, typically served over ice in an old-fashioned glass.

Its exact origin remains uncertain, but it gained significant popularity in the 1970s, coinciding with the release of Francis Ford Coppola's iconic film, "The Godfather." The name itself is widely believed to be a nod to the movie. One popular theory suggests it was a favorite drink of actor Marlon Brando, who famously portrayed Vito Corleone in the film. The inclusion of amaretto, an Italian liqueur, further reinforces the Italian connection implied by the name. Some accounts credit bartender Joseph "Joe" Scialom with creating the cocktail, inspired by the movie, and it became a favorite in disco-era establishments like Studio 54. Another less substantiated theory points to bartender Donato Antone in the 1950s.

While often imbued with a sense of sophistication due to its cinematic association, some modern perspectives suggest that its cultural significance is largely a product of marketing and that it primarily gained traction as a straightforward, easily prepared drink. Nevertheless, it was also a favored drink of the Rat Pack.

Variations of the Godfather cocktail include the Godmother, which substitutes vodka for Scotch, the French Connection, which uses cognac, and the Godchild, which uses other brandies.
