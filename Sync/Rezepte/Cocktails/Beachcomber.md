# History
The "Beachcomber" cocktail is a classic drink with a somewhat debated origin, deeply intertwined with the rise of Tiki culture in the United States. It is thought to have emerged in the early 1930s, gaining popularity during the Prohibition Era due to the availability of rum.

Its history is closely linked to Ernest Raymond Beaumont Gantt, also known as Donn Beach, who opened his influential "Don the Beachcomber" restaurant in Hollywood, California, in 1934. This establishment is credited with being a birthplace of Tiki culture, introducing exotic cocktails and a romanticized vision of the South Seas to America. Donn Beach was renowned for his innovative mixology, creating complex recipes with rum and exotic ingredients.

However, there is also a competing claim regarding the cocktail's invention. Another prominent figure in Tiki culture, Victor "Trader Vic" Bergeron, is also suggested to have created the Beachcomber cocktail, publishing a recipe for it in his 1947 Bartender's Guide. The exact originator remains unclear.

The Beachcomber is characterized as a refreshing and easy-to-drink cocktail, making it a popular choice for summertime. It is considered a classic Tiki cocktail. Its core ingredients generally include white rum, triple sec (or Cointreau/orange liqueur), lime juice, and maraschino liqueur.
