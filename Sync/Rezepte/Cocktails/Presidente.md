# History
The Presidente cocktail is a classic Cuban drink with a rich history, tracing its origins back to Havana around 1913 or 1915. It gained significant popularity during the American Prohibition era (1920s-1940s) when Americans flocked to Havana for legal alcoholic beverages, quickly becoming a favorite among the Cuban upper class.

There are competing theories regarding the cocktail's namesake and inventor. Some believe it was named in honor of Mario García Menocal, who served as Cuba's president from 1913 to 1921. Others suggest it was named after Gerardo Machado, a general and president from 1925 to 1933.

As for its creation, some sources credit American bartender Eddie Woelke, who worked at the Jockey Club in Havana, with inventing the drink and naming it after General Menocal. However, Constantino Ribalaigua Vert, known as "el Rey de Los Cocteleros" (the King of Cocktails) and head bartender at El Floridita Bar in Havana, is also credited with perfecting the drink's proportions and establishing it as a classic. The cocktail first appeared in print in John B. Escalante's 1915 "Manual de Cantineros" (Bartender's Manual).

The traditional Presidente cocktail is made with rum, blanc vermouth, dry curaçao, and a dash of grenadine. It was considered "the aristocrat of cocktails" and was even offered to U.S. President Calvin Coolidge during his visit to Havana in 1928, though Coolidge declined due to Prohibition.
