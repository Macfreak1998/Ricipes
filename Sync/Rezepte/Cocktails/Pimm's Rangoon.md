# History
The "Pimm's Rangoon" cocktail is a modern and creative drink that does not have a widely documented historical origin. It is a variation of the classic "Pimm's Cup," with the "Rangoon" in its name likely referring to a specific location (Rangoon, the former capital of Myanmar) or a creative element, designed to evoke an exotic or Asian-inspired twist.

The **Pimm's Cup** is a traditional British cocktail with a rich history, originating in London in the early 19th century. It was invented by James Pimm, who owned an oyster bar, in the early 1840s. Pimm initially created the gin-based concoction as a digestive aid, serving it in a small tankard referred to as the "No. 1 cup," which gave the drink its original name, "Pimm's No. 1 Cup." Its popularity grew rapidly, and it became a quintessential British summer drink, strongly associated with prominent summer sporting and social events like Wimbledon. A classic Pimm's Cup is typically mixed with English-style lemonade and garnished generously with an assortment of fresh fruits and botanicals, such as cucumber, mint, orange slices, lemon, apple, and strawberries.

This "Pimm's Rangoon" recipe features Gin, Ginger Ale, Lemon, and Cucumber peel. It takes the core elements of a Pimm's Cup (gin, mixer, fruit/botanical garnishes) and adapts them with ginger ale as the mixer, creating a refreshing and subtly spicy variation. The name "Rangoon" might suggest an exotic, perhaps Southeast Asian, influence on this classic British drink.
