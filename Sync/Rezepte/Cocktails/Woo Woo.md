# History
The Woo Woo cocktail, a sweet and fruity drink made with vodka, peach schnapps, and cranberry juice, emerged in the United States between the 1970s and 1980s. While its exact origin remains somewhat murky, it gained significant popularity in the 1980s.

One popular theory suggests the Woo Woo was invented at the First Edition Bar in the Bayside neighborhood of New York City. According to this account, waiters would enthusiastically shout "Woo Woo" when serving the drink, a tradition that spread to other bars. Another theory attributes the creation to a Florida bartender in the 1980s who aimed to promote peach schnapps. The Oxford Companion To Spirits & Cocktails suggests it may have originated in the singles bars of New York's Upper East Side during the mid-1980s.

The 1980s marked the "golden age" of peach schnapps, and the Woo Woo was one of the first cocktails to feature this ingredient prominently. It is closely related to the Sex on the Beach cocktail, with the primary difference being the absence of orange juice in the Woo Woo. Often served in a highball glass and garnished with a lime slice, the Woo Woo is known for its easy-to-drink profile and memorable name. This recipe, with peach schnapps, vodka, and cranberry juice, is a classic example of this popular and party-oriented cocktail.
