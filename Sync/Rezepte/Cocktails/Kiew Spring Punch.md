# History
The Kiew Spring Punch is a modern renaming of the classic cocktail, the Russian Spring Punch. The original drink was created by the legendary bartender Dick Bradsell in London in the 1980s. It is a refreshing and elegant mix of vodka, crème de cassis, lemon juice, and sparkling wine.

The "Russian Spring Punch" was one of Bradsell's signature creations, and it quickly became a popular drink in London and around the world. The name was chosen to evoke a sense of celebration and renewal, and it has no direct ties to Russia.

In recent years, due to the political climate, many bars and bartenders have chosen to rename the drink to the "Kiew Spring Punch" or "Ukrainian Spring Punch" as a sign of solidarity with Ukraine. The recipe remains the same, but the name has been changed to reflect a desire to distance the drink from its association with Russia.
