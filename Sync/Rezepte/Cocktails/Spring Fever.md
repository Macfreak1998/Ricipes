# History
The "Spring Fever" cocktail does not have a singular, long-standing historical origin. Instead, it appears to be a name given to several distinct cocktail creations by different individuals and establishments, often evoking a sense of freshness, new beginnings, and vibrant flavors associated with the spring season.

This particular recipe, with lemon juice, mango syrup, pineapple juice, and orange juice, is a non-alcoholic version designed to be a refreshing and fruity mocktail. It captures the essence of "spring fever" through its bright and tropical flavor profile. While many alcoholic versions of "Spring Fever" cocktails exist, often incorporating spirits like gin or vodka with floral or fruity liqueurs, this recipe offers a delightful and accessible option for those seeking a vibrant, alcohol-free beverage. Its origins are likely modern and tied to the desire for refreshing, fruit-forward drinks.
