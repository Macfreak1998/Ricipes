# History
The Rob Roy cocktail was first created in 1894 by a bartender at the Waldorf Astoria hotel in Manhattan, New York City. The drink was named to commemorate the premiere of an operetta titled "Rob Roy," which was based on the Scottish folk hero Robert Roy MacGregor.

This classic cocktail is closely related to the Manhattan, with the key distinction being the type of whisky used. While a Manhattan traditionally features rye, bourbon, or Canadian whisky, the Rob Roy is made exclusively with Scotch whisky. The core ingredients of a Rob Roy are Scotch whisky, sweet vermouth, and a dash of Angostura bitters.

Similar to the Manhattan, the Rob Roy can be prepared in different styles: "sweet" (using sweet vermouth), "dry" (using dry vermouth), or "perfect" (combining equal parts sweet and dry vermouth). This recipe, with both dry and sweet vermouth, is a "perfect" Rob Roy, offering a balanced and sophisticated Scotch-based cocktail.
