# History
The "Don's Own Grog" cocktail is a classic tiki drink created by the legendary Donn Beach (also known as Don the Beachcomber) around 1937. It appeared on his first menu and was notable for being a significant departure from the traditional naval grog.

The original concept of "grog" dates back to 1740, when British Vice-Admiral Edward Vernon ordered that the daily rum ration for sailors be diluted with water to curb drunkenness. Vernon, nicknamed "Old Grog," inadvertently gave his name to this mixture. Later, lime juice and sugar were added to combat scurvy and make it more palatable.

Donn Beach, a pioneer of the tiki cocktail movement, took the historical term "grog" and reinterpreted it with his own unique creations. "Don's Own Grog" is one such invention, showcasing his innovative approach to cocktails that often involved complex blends of rums and exotic ingredients.

While the original naval grog had a clear functional meaning related to naval discipline and health, "Don's Own Grog" carries a different significance. Its "meaning" lies primarily in its representation of Donn Beach's creative genius and his pivotal role in establishing tiki culture. It signifies a move away from the simple, utilitarian grog to a more elaborate and flavorful cocktail designed for enjoyment and escapism, characteristic of the tiki aesthetic. The name "Don's Own" emphasizes its personal creation by Donn Beach, distinguishing it from the historical naval drink.
