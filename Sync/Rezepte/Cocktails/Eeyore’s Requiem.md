# History
The "Eeyore's Requiem" is a notable cocktail with a distinct history, origin, and a name that cleverly reflects its character.

The "Eeyore's Requiem" cocktail was created around 2009 by Toby Maloney at The Violet Hour, a renowned bar in Chicago, USA. It has since been featured in his 2022 book, "The Bartender's Manifesto," and has also appeared in publications like Imbibe Magazine.

The cocktail is named after Eeyore, the famously melancholic donkey character from A.A. Milne's Winnie the Pooh stories. Toby Maloney reportedly chose the name because he considered Eeyore to be "the most bitter character in literature." This naming is a direct nod to the cocktail's intensely bittersweet and complex flavor profile, which features multiple bitter Italian liqueurs. While the name might suggest a gloomy drink, the cocktail is celebrated for its surprising depth and balance.

The "Eeyore's Requiem" is often described as an "exploration of the Negroni template," taking the classic bitter notes of a Negroni and amplifying them with additional bitter components. It is known for being a complex and sometimes polarizing cocktail due to its pronounced bitterness. However, despite its bitter ingredients, it is also noted for celebrating fruity citrus and herbal complexities, managing to be both dry and sweet without being overwhelmingly bitter.

Its key ingredients typically include Campari, Blanc Vermouth, Gin, Cynar, Fernet Branca, and Orange Bitters. The cocktail is typically stirred with ice and strained into a chilled glass, often garnished with expressed orange peel to add aromatic oils.
