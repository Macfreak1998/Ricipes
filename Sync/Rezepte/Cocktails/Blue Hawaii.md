# History
The "Blue Hawaii" cocktail was invented in 1957 by Harry Yee, the head bartender at the Hilton Hawaiian Village (then Kaiser Hawaiian Village) in Waikiki, Hawaii.

Yee created the drink at the request of a sales representative from Bols, a Dutch distiller, who wanted a cocktail to showcase their blue Curaçao liqueur. His aim was to craft a unique "Hawaiian drink" that tourists couldn't find elsewhere and that visually resembled the blue waters of the Hawaiian oceaccordingly.

The name "Blue Hawaii" is not directly from the 1961 Elvis Presley film of the same name, as is commonly believed. Instead, it was inspired by the title song from the 1937 Bing Crosby film "Waikiki Wedding," a movie Yee admired.

The classic recipe for a Blue Hawaii typically includes light rum, vodka, blue Curaçao, pineapple juice, and a sweet and sour mix. It is important to note that the "Blue Hawaii" is distinct from the "Blue Hawaiian," as the former does not contain coconut cream.
