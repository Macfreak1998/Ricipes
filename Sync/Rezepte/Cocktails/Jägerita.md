# History
The "Jägerita" cocktail is a modern variation that combines elements of the classic Margarita with Jägermeister. It was created by David Cordoba in September 2008. Jeffrey Morgenthaler, an influential bartender, helped popularize the drink after trying it in London and later featuring it on the menu of his bar, Pépé Le Moko, in 2014.

The **Margarita cocktail** itself has a history largely shrouded in mystery and folklore, with numerous origin stories. Cocktail historian David Wondrich suggests that the Margarita is a variation of the "brandy daisy," remade with tequila instead of brandy. "Margarita" is the Spanish word for "daisy," which further supports this theory, as "daisy" cocktails typically consist of a base spirit, liqueur, and citrus. Despite the varying accounts, it is widely believed that the Margarita originated in the US/Mexico border regions between the 1930s and early 1950s. The cocktail typically consists of tequila, triple sec (or other orange liqueur), and lime juice, often served with salt on the rim of the glass.

**Jägermeister** is a German herbal liqueur created in 1934 by Curt Mast. It is made from a secret blend of 56 different fruits, roots, herbs, and spices. The name "Jägermeister" literally translates to "master of the hunt" in English, reflecting Curt Mast's passion for hunting. It was originally conceived as a digestif, meant to aid digestion.

The Jägerita essentially substitutes Jägermeister for tequila as the base spirit in a Margarita-style drink. This particular recipe includes Jägermeister, Cointreau, Fresh Lime Juice, and Simple Syrup. The drink is noted for its unique flavor profile, showcasing that Jägermeister can be effectively used in cocktails beyond traditional "Jägerbombs."
