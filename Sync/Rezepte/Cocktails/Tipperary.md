# History

The Tipperary cocktail, a classic with Irish roots, emerged in the early 20th century. Its first known appearance in print was in Hugo Ensslin's 1916 book, "Recipes for Mixed Drinks." This publication marked a significant moment for Irish whiskey's inclusion in classic cocktails.



The cocktail is named after County Tipperary in central Ireland, and its popularity coincided with the 1914 wartime song "It's a Long, Long Way to Tipperary," an anthem for Irish soldiers during World War I. While some accounts suggest the drink was named to honor an Irish soldier humming the tune in a bar, another theory posits a more straightforward origin, simply referring to the Irish county.



The original Tipperary recipe, as penned by Ensslin, called for equal parts Irish whiskey, sweet vermouth, and green Chartreuse, along with a small amount of absinthe and Angostura bitters. This equal-parts approach appealed to the palate of the early 20th century. Over time, the proportions have seen variations, with some modern interpretations favoring a higher ratio of Irish whiskey. The cocktail gained popularity in the United States, even finding its way into speakeasies during the Prohibition era. This recipe, with Irish whiskey, sweet vermouth, green Chartreuse, and orange bitters, aligns with the classic proportions of this enduring Irish cocktail.
