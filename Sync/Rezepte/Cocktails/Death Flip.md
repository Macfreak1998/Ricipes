# History
The "Death Flip" cocktail was created in 2010 by Chris Hysted-Adams, the manager of The Black Pearl bar in Melbourne, Australia.

The cocktail is a modern classic that combines Blanco Tequila, Yellow Chartreuse, Jägermeister, simple syrup, and a whole egg, typically garnished with fresh ground nutmeg.

It falls into the "Flip" category of cocktails, which traditionally include an entire egg (both yolk and white) to create a creamy texture and foam. The "Death" in its name is thought to refer to the drink's potency and is also a nod to a daring skateboard trick, symbolizing the challenging and unexpected flavor profile of the drink.

Upon its launch, The Black Pearl employed a unique marketing strategy by keeping the ingredients a secret and describing it with the ominous phrase, "You don't wanna meet this cocktail in a dark alley." This approach contributed to its mystique and helped it gain international acclaim as a surprisingly smooth, complex, and potent drink despite its unconventional combination of spirits.
