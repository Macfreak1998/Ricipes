# History
The "Cranberry Cooler" is a descriptive term for a refreshing drink featuring cranberry, and its history is largely intertwined with the popular "Cape Codder" or "Vodka Cranberry" cocktail.

The vodka cranberry drink was primarily a marketing invention by Ocean Spray in the 1940s, designed to encourage the sale and consumption of cranberry juice. It first appeared in an Ocean Spray newsletter in 1945 under the name "Red Devil" cocktail. However, this name did not gain traction. By the 1950s, the drink was rebranded and became widely known as the "Cape Codder" or "Cape Cod," particularly in New England. Ocean Spray heavily promoted the cocktail through advertising campaigns, solidifying its place in popular culture.

The name "Cape Codder" directly references Cape Cod, Massachusetts, a region known for its cranberry bogs and significant cranberry production. The drink's creation was a strategic move to highlight cranberries as a versatile ingredient for beverages.

The basic "Cape Codder" is a simple concoction of vodka and cranberry juice served over ice, often garnished with a lime wedge. Over time, numerous variations have emerged, including the "Cranberry Cooler," which often adds orange juice to the mix, creating a sweeter and more complex flavor profile. Other variations include the "Rose Kennedy" (with club soda), "Sea Breeze" (with grapefruit juice), and "Bay Breeze" (with pineapple juice). The "Cosmopolitan" is a more recent and famous variation from the 1980s.
