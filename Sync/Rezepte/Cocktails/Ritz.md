# History
The "Ritz" cocktail, as described in this recipe, is most closely associated with the "Ritz Cocktail" created in the mid-1980s by Dale DeGroff, often recognized as a pioneer of modern mixology. DeGroff developed the drink in 1985 while working at Aurora in New York, and it later gained popularity when featured on the menu at the Rainbow Room.

His inspiration came from existing cocktails linked to the London and Paris Ritz hotels, leading him to devise a "Ritz Cocktail for New York." The Ritz Cocktail is characterized by its blend of cognac, orange liqueur (such as Cointreau), fresh lemon juice (though not explicitly in this recipe, it's a common component), maraschino liqueur (also not in this recipe, but part of some versions), and a topping of Champagne.

This recipe, with orange juice, cognac, Cointreau, and Champagne, aligns with the spirit of DeGroff's creation, offering a sophisticated and celebratory drink that evokes the elegance of the Ritz name. It is distinct from the "Ritz Fizz," which was established in 1934 as the signature cocktail for the Ritz-Carlton hotel chain.
