# History
In Cold Blood is a modern craft cocktail created by Andrew Volk (@andrewvolk) at Hunt & Alpine (@alpineboulevardier) in Portland, Maine. As featured by @anatomyofadrink, this cocktail represents a contemporary approach to stirred, spirit-forward drinks with Italian amaro.

The drink's creator describes it as "approachable but geeky with the salt." The salt reference is key—adding flaky sea salt as a garnish helps accentuate flavors and balance the bitterness of Cynar (artichoke amaro). This technique represents modern bartending's understanding of how salt enhances flavor perception and balances bitterness, similar to a pinch of salt in coffee or chocolate.

**The Name:**

"In Cold Blood" evokes Truman Capote's famous 1966 true crime novel, suggesting something dark, sophisticated, and literary. The name positions this as a serious cocktail for discerning drinkers, not a casual party drink.

**Flavor Architecture:**

The equal-parts formula (1:1:1) creates perfect balance:

- **Rye Whiskey**: Provides spice, grain character, and backbone
- **Sweet Vermouth**: Adds wine character, herbal complexity, and sweetness
- **Cynar**: Contributes artichoke bitterness, herbal notes, and Italian character

This combination creates a drink that's "approachable but geeky"—sophisticated enough for cocktail nerds but balanced enough for newcomers to bitter drinks.

**The Cynar Factor:**

Cynar is an Italian artichoke amaro that's less aggressive than Fernet or Campari but still distinctly bitter. Its vegetal, earthy character pairs beautifully with rye's spice and sweet vermouth's wine base. Cynar became trendy in the 2010s-2020s as bartenders explored beyond Campari and Aperol.

**The Salt Technique:**

Using flaky sea salt as a garnish (rather than a rim) is a modern technique popularized by craft cocktail bars. The salt sits on the surface, and you get small bursts of salinity with each sip. This approach is more elegant than a salted rim and allows you to control salt intake.

**Clear Ice Aesthetic:**

The recipe specifically calls for "clear ice by @abstract_ice," reflecting Portland's craft cocktail scene's attention to presentation. Clear ice (made by directional freezing to remove air bubbles) looks more elegant than cloudy ice and melts slower, providing better dilution control.

**Portland Cocktail Scene:**

Hunt & Alpine is part of Portland, Maine's reputation as a craft cocktail destination. The city's bar scene has gained national recognition for creative, thoughtful drinks that balance innovation with tradition. In Cold Blood exemplifies this approach—using classic techniques (stirred, spirit-forward) with modern touches (Cynar, salt garnish, clear ice).

The cocktail represents the contemporary American approach to Italian-style aperitivi: maintaining bitter complexity while making drinks approachable through careful balance and thoughtful garnishing.
