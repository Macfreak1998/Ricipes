# History
The "Paddington" cocktail was created in the autumn of 2008 by David Slape at PDT (Please Don't Tell) Bar in New York City.

The cocktail is named after a taxidermied black bear that adorned the wall of the bar, which was nicknamed "Paddington." While some might assume the name refers to Paddington Bear due to the marmalade ingredient, the cocktail's namesake is indeed the bar's taxidermy bear.

The recipe for the Paddington cocktail typically includes light gold rum, orange marmalade, aromatized wine (such as Lillet Blanc), pink grapefruit juice, lemon juice, and an absinthe rinse. It is described as a sweet and sour drink with citrus tartness and a faint anise flavor from the absinthe. The combination of ingredients, particularly the grapefruit and marmalade, contributes a subtle bitterness, resulting in a well-balanced and delicious cocktail. The recipe was adapted from Jim Meehan's 2011 *The PDT Cocktail Book*.
