# History
The "Knickerbocker Cocktail" is a name applied to various drinks, with a classic American version having roots in the mid-19th century. The original Knickerbocker Cocktail first appeared on beverage lists around the 1850s, with its earliest known mention in 1843. The first published recipe was in Jerry Thomas's influential 1862 "The Bartender's Guide." This historical version typically called for Santa Cruz rum, raspberry syrup, lime juice, and Curaçao, served over shaved ice. The name "Knickerbocker" itself derives from the term referring to Dutch settlers in New York and, more broadly, anything associated with New York.

This particular recipe, featuring Dry Vermouth, Sweet Vermouth, Gin, Maraschino Liqueur, and Lemon Zest, with a Pernod float, is a unique interpretation of a "Knickerbocker Cocktail." It deviates significantly from the rum-based original, instead offering a Martini-style drink with a complex blend of gin, vermouths, and liqueurs. The inclusion of both dry and sweet vermouth makes it a "perfect" Martini variation, while the maraschino liqueur adds a subtle sweetness and the Pernod float introduces a distinctive anise note. This sophisticated and aromatic cocktail offers a modern take on a classic name, emphasizing gin and herbal notes over the tropical fruitiness of the original.
