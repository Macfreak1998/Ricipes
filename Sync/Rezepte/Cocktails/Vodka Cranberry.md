# History
The Vodka Cranberry cocktail, often referred to as the Cape Codder, originated in the 1940s as a marketing initiative by Ocean Spray. The cranberry growers' cooperative aimed to boost sales of their cranberry products by promoting the juice as a mixer for alcoholic beverages.

Initially, the cocktail was known as the "Red Devil" and is rumored to have first appeared in the summer bars of Cape Cod. However, this name did not widely catch on. By the 1950s, the drink was rebranded as the "Cape Codder" and began to gain popularity, particularly along the East Coast. Ocean Spray actively marketed the "Cape Codder," with advertisements appearing in publications like The New Yorker in 1965 and Time magazine in 1966.

The cocktail's enduring appeal lies in its straightforward combination of vodka and the tart sweetness of cranberry juice, often garnished with a lime wedge to enhance its flavor. Over time, several variations have emerged, including the Sea Breeze (with grapefruit juice), the Madras (with orange juice), and the Rose Kennedy (with a splash of soda). This recipe, with vodka and cranberry juice, is a classic example of this simple and refreshing cocktail.
