# History
The Pampelle Spritz is a modern and refreshing take on the classic Italian Spritz. While the concept of the "spritz" dates back to the 19th century in Italy, the Pampelle Spritz is a more recent creation, gaining popularity with the introduction of Pampelle Ruby L'Apéro.

Pampelle Ruby L'Apéro is a French grapefruit aperitif, crafted in Cognac, France, using Ruby Red grapefruits from Corsica. It was created with the intention of offering a unique, bittersweet, and citrus-forward alternative to traditional Italian aperitifs.

The Pampelle Spritz combines this distinctive grapefruit aperitif with Prosecco and a splash of soda water, creating a vibrant and zesty cocktail. It has become a popular choice for those seeking a lighter, fruitier spritz experience, especially during warmer months.
