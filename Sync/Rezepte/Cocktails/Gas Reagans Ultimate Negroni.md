# History
The "Gas Reagans Ultimate Negroni" is a modern and unique variation of the classic Negroni cocktail. While there is no widely documented historical origin for a cocktail specifically named "Gas Reagans Ultimate Negroni," it is clearly a creative interpretation that builds upon the foundation of the traditional Negroni.

The classic Negroni cocktail is believed to have originated in Florence, Italy, in 1919. The most widely accepted story attributes its creation to Count Camillo Negroni, who asked bartender Fosco Scarselli at Caffè Casoni to strengthen his favorite cocktail, the Americano. Scarselli replaced the soda water in the Americano with gin and switched the lemon garnish to an orange slice, thus creating the Negroni. The Negroni is considered an aperitif, a drink typically consumed before a meal to stimulate the appetite, and is known for its perfect balance of bitter, sweet, and strong flavors.

This "Gas Reagans Ultimate Negroni" recipe features Gin, Jagermeister, and Sweet Vermouth. It deviates from the classic Negroni's use of Campari, replacing it with Jagermeister. This substitution introduces a distinct herbal, licorice-like, and slightly sweeter profile from the Jagermeister, creating a unique and bold twist on the traditional bitter-sweet balance of a Negroni. The name "Gas Reagans Ultimate Negroni" likely reflects a personal preference or a playful homage, perhaps to a specific individual or a particular flavor profile.
