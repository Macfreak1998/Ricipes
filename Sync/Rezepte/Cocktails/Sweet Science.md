# History
The "Sweet Science" cocktail does not appear to have a single, widely documented historical origin as a classic cocktail. Instead, the name "Sweet Science" is used for various modern cocktail creations, often evoking a sense of balance, precision, and a delightful interplay of flavors. The term "sweet science" itself is a poetic euphemism for boxing, suggesting a blend of power and finesse.

This particular recipe, with orange juice, Drambuie, and Scotch, is a unique creation that combines the rich, smoky notes of Scotch with the herbal sweetness of Drambuie and the bright citrus of orange juice. The year "1981" in the categories might indicate a specific creation date for this particular recipe, placing it within the modern era of cocktail development.

While other cocktails bearing the "Sweet Science" name might feature different ingredients (such as vodka, strawberries, and lemon), this version offers a distinct flavor profile. It's a sophisticated and balanced drink that likely emerged from the creativity of a bartender seeking to craft a cocktail that embodies both the "sweet" and "scientific" aspects of mixology.
