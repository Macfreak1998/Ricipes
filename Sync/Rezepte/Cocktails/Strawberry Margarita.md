# History
The Strawberry Margarita is a popular fruit-flavored variation of the classic Margarita cocktail. While the exact origin of the Strawberry Margarita itself isn't precisely documented, its emergence is a natural evolution of the original Margarita, which has a rich and debated history.

The classic Margarita, typically made with tequila, lime juice, and triple sec, is believed to have originated in the US/Mexico border region sometime between the 1930s and early 1950s. Several stories surround its invention, often crediting bartenders in Mexico or the US with its creation for specific patrons.

The widespread popularity of fruit-flavored Margaritas, such as the Strawberry Margarita, was significantly boosted by the invention of the frozen Margarita machine. In 1971, Mariano Martinez of Dallas, Texas, adapted a soft-serve ice cream machine to create frozen margaritas, making blended fruit versions much more accessible and popular. Today, the Margarita has evolved into numerous variations, with strawberry being one of the many fruit flavors enjoyed. This recipe, with tequila blanco, lime juice, simple syrup, raspberry syrup, and cherries, prepared in a blender, is a classic example of this popular fruity variation.
