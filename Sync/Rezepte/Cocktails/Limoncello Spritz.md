# History
The Limoncello Spritz is a modern and refreshing Italian cocktail that combines the vibrant lemon liqueur, Limoncello, with sparkling Prosecco and a splash of soda water. It is a variation of the classic Italian Spritz, which has been enjoyed in Italy for over a century.

Limoncello itself has a rich history, originating on Italy's Amalfi Coast around the early 20th century. Traditionally made from the zest of local "sfusato" lemons, it was conceived as a digestivo, a chilled after-dinner liqueur.

The Limoncello Spritz emerged as a natural evolution, blending this beloved lemon liqueur with Italy's favored sparkling wine, Prosecco. This combination creates a light, refreshing, and slightly tart drink that has become a popular aperitivo in Italy and is rapidly gaining international popularity, especially as a summer cocktail. It is often referred to as an "Amalfi Spritz" due to its strong association with the sunny Italian coast.
