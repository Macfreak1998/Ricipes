# History
The Repossession Cocktail was created by Leo Robitschek, a renowned mixologist, initially for the Eleven Madison Park restaurant in New York City. This establishment shares ownership with The NoMad, and the cocktail is prominently featured in "The NoMad Cocktail Book," also authored by Robitschek.

The drink is characterized as a distinctive take on a tequila sour, with amontillado sherry being a key ingredient. Its typical components include reposado tequila, amontillado sherry, apricot liqueur, lemon juice, cane syrup, and a mezcal float. The mezcal is often applied as a spray from an atomizer, adding an aromatic layer to the drink.

This cocktail is a modern creation, showcasing sophisticated flavor combinations and a refined presentation, reflecting the high-end cocktail culture of establishments like Eleven Madison Park and The NoMad.
