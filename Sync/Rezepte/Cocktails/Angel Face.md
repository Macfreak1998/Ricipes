# History
The "Angel Face" cocktail is a classic drink with origins tracing back to the Prohibition era. It first appeared in print in Harry Craddock's "The Savoy Cocktail Book" in 1930, solidifying its status as a classic.

The cocktail is a spirit-forward mix, typically combining dry gin, Calvados (a French apple or pear brandy), and apricot liqueur in equal parts. This blend creates a balanced flavor profile with fruity sweetness from the apricot liqueur, tart notes from the Calvados, and botanical depth from the gin.

As for the meaning behind its name, the most widely accepted theory suggests it's a nod to Abe "Angel Face" Kaminsky, a Detroit mobster known for robbing speakeasies during Prohibition. Despite his "cutesy moniker," Kaminsky was known for his brutal tactics. Other less likely hypotheses suggest it was created by Harry MacElhone in Paris in 1919 to celebrate the end of World War I, or that the name symbolizes the drink's "angelic balance of flavors."

The Angel Face cocktail is recognized as part of the International Bartenders Association (IBA) list of approved cocktails under "The Unforgettables" category, highlighting its enduring elegance and creativity from the Prohibition era.
