# History
The Test Pilot cocktail is a vintage tiki drink created by Donn Beach (also known as Don the Beachcomber) at his California restaurant and bar in the 1930s. Beach was renowned for frequently altering his recipes, leading to multiple versions of the Test Pilot attributed to him and others, making it one of his most imitated and varied tiki creations.

The cocktail's name and theme were inspired by the booming jet engine technology and the rise of commercial aviation in the 1930s and 1940s. This era, known as "The Jet Age," saw significant excitement around aviation, with pilots breaking altitude and speed records.

An early iteration of the Test Pilot cocktail included grape juice and honey, though these ingredients were later omitted in modern recipes. A notable version from circa 1941, documented by tiki expert Jeff "Beachbum" Berry, calls for Jamaican dark rum, Puerto Rican light rum, Cointreau, Pernod (or absinthe), lime juice, falernum syrup, and a dash of bitters. The use of Pernod and bitters was a signature combination for Donn Beach, and many cocktail enthusiasts consider it a crucial element of the recipe.

Trader Vic, another prominent figure in tiki culture, introduced his own adaptation in his 1972 "Trader Vic's Bartender's Guide." Competitors of Beachcomber and Trader Vic also created their own versions, often naming them the "Jet Pilot." This recipe, with dark Jamaican rum, white rum, Cointreau, falernum, lime juice, Angostura bitters, and Pernod, aligns with the classic Donn Beach version of this iconic tiki cocktail.
