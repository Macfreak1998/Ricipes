# History
The "Pimm's No. 1" cocktail, often simply called Pimm's Cup, has a rich history rooted in 19th-century London.

**Origin and History:**
The drink was invented by James Pimm, who owned an oyster bar in London, in the early 1840s (some sources suggest between 1823 and 1840). Pimm initially created the gin-based concoction as a digestive aid, serving it in a small tankard referred to as the "No. 1 cup," which gave the drink its name. Its popularity quickly grew, leading Pimm to expand his business and sell it in bottles to other establishments. Over time, the rights to the drink were acquired by Sir Horatio David Davies, who further popularized it, particularly among London society and the military.

**Meaning and Cultural Significance:**
Pimm's No. 1 is a gin-based liqueur made with a secret blend of herbs and fruit extracts, with the original recipe reportedly including quinine. It is widely regarded as a quintessential British summer drink and a symbol of British summertime hospitality. The cocktail is famously associated with major British sporting and social events, such as the Wimbledon tennis tournament (where the first Pimm's bar opened in 1971), the Henley Royal Regatta, and the Chelsea Flower Show.

**Preparation:**
A classic Pimm's No. 1 Cup is typically mixed with English-style lemonade (similar to lemon-lime soda in the United States) and garnished generously with a variety of fresh fruits and herbs. Common garnishes include cucumber, mint, orange slices, lemon, apple, and strawberries. While Pimm's later introduced other "cups" with different spirit bases (such as No. 2 with Scotch, No. 3 with brandy, and No. 6 with vodka), Pimm's No. 1 remains the most popular and widely consumed.
