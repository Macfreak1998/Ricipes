# History
The Rosita cocktail, a tequila-based drink often likened to a Negroni, has a somewhat mysterious and evolving history. Its name, meaning "little rose" in Spanish, is thought to allude to its delicate and floral notes, and it may also have been named after a woman.

While some theories suggest the Rosita originated in the United States during the Prohibition era of the 1920s, other accounts point to a Mexican origin during the cocktail renaissance of the 1950s, possibly in Tijuana, though its creator remains unknown.

The cocktail's recipe first appeared in print in the 1974 edition of *Mr. Boston Official Bartender's Guide*. Its popularity significantly increased thanks to the late Gary "Gaz" Regan, who encountered the drink and contributed to its modern form by adding a dash of bitters and increasing the tequila content. The Rosita is celebrated for its complex flavor profile, blending tequila with sweet and dry vermouths and Campari, making it a favorite among those seeking a sophisticated and unique drink. This recipe, with tequila blanco, dry vermouth, sweet vermouth, and Campari, aligns with the classic proportions of this intriguing cocktail.
