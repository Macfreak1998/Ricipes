# History
There isn't a single, universally recognized "Touchdown cocktail" with a clear historical origin. Instead, the name "Touchdown" appears to be used for several distinct drink recipes, likely referencing American football.

This particular recipe, with peach syrup, grenadine, lemon juice, and passion fruit juice, is a non-alcoholic version designed to be a fruity and sweet long drink. It aligns with variations that are described as refreshing and well-known in many bars, offering a vibrant and flavorful experience without alcohol.

While some alcoholic "Touchdown" cocktails exist, often featuring vodka, apricot brandy, or bourbon, this recipe provides a delicious and accessible option for those seeking a refreshing, alcohol-free beverage. Its origins are likely modern and tied to the desire for appealing, themed drinks.
