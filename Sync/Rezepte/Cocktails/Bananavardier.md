# History
The "Bananavardier" cocktail is a modern twist on the classic "Boulevardier," a drink with roots in 1920s Paris. The name "Bananavardier" is a portmanteau of "Banana" and "Boulevardier," reflecting its core modification.

The original Boulevardier cocktail was created in the late 1920s in Paris and is attributed to Erskine Gwynne, an American writer who published a magazine also called "Boulevardier." The recipe first appeared in Harry McElhone's 1927 cocktail book, "Barflies and Cocktails." It consists of whiskey, sweet vermouth, and Campari.

The Bananavardier emerged when bartenders discovered that banana liqueur and Campari paired well together, leading to the idea of integrating this flavor combination into the Boulevardier structure. It was initially known as a "Banana Boulevardier" before evolving into its current name.

The cocktail's meaning lies in its innovative adaptation of a classic. It represents a creative exploration of flavor profiles, where the bitterness of Campari is balanced by the sweetness of banana liqueur, offering a unique take on the traditional Boulevardier. The banana notes in the Bananavardier are typically subtle.
