# History
The "I.B.F." cocktail, which stands for "International Bar Fly," has a rich history rooted in the Parisian bar scene of the 1920s. It was created by renowned bartender Harry MacElhone, proprietor of Harry's American Bar in Paris, and first appeared in his 1930 publication, "Harry's ABC of Mixing Cocktails."

The cocktail's name is intrinsically linked to a secret society co-founded by MacElhone in 1924 with O. McIntyre, known as the "International Bar Flies" (IBF). This fraternity was established with the stated purpose of "the uplift and downfall of serious drinkers." Harry's American Bar continues to operate, and the IBF remains an active organization, boasting 130 chapters globally, referred to as "fly traps." Notable historical members of this exclusive club include literary figures such as F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway.

The "International Bar Fly" cocktail is characterized as a sophisticated and effervescent drink. Its recipe typically includes brandy, Triple Sec, Fernet-Branca Liqueur, and is topped with Champagne or Prosecco. This combination results in a complex flavor profile that balances rich, fruity notes with citrus sweetness, herbal accents, and a refreshing fizziness, making it a suitable choice for celebrations. This particular recipe features Brandy, Triple Sec, Fernet Branca, and Champagne, creating a vibrant and complex celebratory drink.
