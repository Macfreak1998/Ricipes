# History
The Coconut Mojito is a tropical variation of the classic Cuban Mojito, shared by Instagram bartender @thats.thespirits as part of their "Tiki Week" cocktail series. This creative adaptation represents the modern trend of reimagining classic cocktails with tropical ingredients for tiki-themed menus.

**The Classic Mojito:**

The traditional Mojito (rum, mint, lime, sugar, soda water) has been Cuba's national cocktail since the 16th century. Its origins trace back to "El Draque," a medicinal drink pirates used to combat scurvy and dysentery. The modern Mojito became internationally famous at Havana's La Bodeguita del Medio bar, where Ernest Hemingway was a regular patron.

**The Tropical Twist:**

This coconut variation adds cream of coconut (the sweet, thick coconut cream made famous by Coco López) to the classic formula, creating a drink that bridges the gap between a traditional mojito and a piña colada. The cream of coconut adds:
- **Richness**: A silky, creamy texture that contrasts with the traditional mojito's light, refreshing quality
- **Sweetness**: Natural coconut sweetness that complements the mint and lime
- **Tropical Character**: Coconut transforms this from a Cuban classic to a pan-Caribbean tropical drink

**Tiki Connection:**

The bartender's "tropic twist" description and inclusion in "Tiki Week" positions this as a tiki-style cocktail despite its Cuban mojito roots. This reflects tiki culture's eclectic approach to tropical drinks—pulling from Caribbean, Polynesian, and Latin American traditions to create a fantasy version of tropical paradise.

The Coconut Mojito works perfectly as a gateway drink for those who find classic mojitos too herbal or tart, offering the familiar mojito template with additional sweetness and tropical appeal. It's also an excellent choice for poolside or beach drinking, combining refreshment with indulgence.
