# History
The "Gin & It" cocktail boasts a rich history, originating in the late 1800s as the "Sweet Martini" in New York. Its name evolved to "Gin and Italian" due to the use of Italian vermouth, and during Prohibition in the United States, it was shortened to "Gin & It." This period also saw its popularity spread to Britain, where it became a common pub drink. The "It" in the name specifically refers to "Italian vermouth" or "sweet vermouth," as Italy is the primary source of this ingredient.

This simple, two-ingredient cocktail combines gin and sweet vermouth, offering a fruity and bittersweet flavor profile with complex botanicals. It is often enjoyed as an aperitivo and traditionally garnished with a cocktail cherry. Historically, the proportions of gin to vermouth have varied, with earlier versions sometimes containing more vermouth, while modern recipes often feature a higher gin content. The "Gin & It" is considered a less fussy cocktail, meant to be enjoyed rather than meticulously crafted, and was even a favorite of author Agatha Christie.
