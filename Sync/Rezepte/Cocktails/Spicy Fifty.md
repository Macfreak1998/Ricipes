# History

The Spicy Fifty cocktail was created by the renowned mixologist Salvatore Calabrese in the early 2000s, specifically around 2004-2005. It was developed as a signature drink for the inaugural menu of his London bar, Fifty, which opened in February 2005.



The cocktail is characterized by its blend of vanilla-flavored vodka, elderflower cordial, fresh lime juice, honey syrup, and red chili pepper, offering a unique sweet, sour, and spicy flavor profile. Calabrese's inspiration for incorporating chili came from Michelin-starred chef Jean-George Vongerichten, who featured chili prominently in his dishes at the restaurant Rama, located in the same building as Calabrese's bar. The period also saw vanilla-flavored vodkas and elderflower cordial as popular ingredients in London's cocktail scene.



The Spicy Fifty cocktail gained further recognition when it was added to the list of IBA (International Bartenders Association) official cocktails in 2020. This recipe, with vanilla vodka, elderflower liqueur, lime juice, honey syrup, and red chili, is a classic example of this modern and innovative cocktail.
