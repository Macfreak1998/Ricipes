# History
The "Jäger Buck cocktail" is a modern twist on the classic "Buck cocktail" formula, incorporating Jägermeister as its base spirit. While the specific historical origin of the "Jäger Buck" itself isn't extensively documented beyond being a community recipe from 2023, its meaning and composition are derived from its two namesake components.

**Jägermeister History:**
Jägermeister is a German herbal liqueur developed in 1934 by Curt Mast. The liqueur is made from a secret blend of 56 different fruits, roots, herbs, and spices, and has an alcohol by volume (ABV) of 35%. It was originally conceived as a digestif, meant to aid digestion. The name "Jägermeister" literally translates to "master of the hunt" or "hunt master" in German, a title for a high-ranking official in charge of hunting and gamekeeping. The iconic logo features a haloed deer head with a cross between its antlers, referencing the legend of Saint Hubertus, the patron saint of hunters.

**Buck Cocktail History and Meaning:**
A "Buck" is a family of cocktails characterized by the inclusion of ginger ale or ginger beer, citrus juice (often lime), and a base liquor. The name "Buck" is believed to have originated from the idea that adding alcohol to the previously non-alcoholic "Horse's Neck" (ginger ale and lemon juice) gave the drink a "kick," like a bucking horse. The "Buck" cocktail is thought to have emerged around the early 1900s. Variations of the Buck cocktail are numerous and often named after their base spirit, such as the Whiskey Buck, Rum Buck, and the well-known Vodka Buck, also called a Moscow Mule.

The "Jäger Buck cocktail" combines Jägermeister with the classic "Buck" ingredients. This particular recipe includes Jägermeister, Ginger Syrup, Lime Juice, and Soda Water, making it a refreshing, herbal, and spicy drink, leveraging Jägermeister's unique flavor profile within the established "Buck" cocktail structure.
