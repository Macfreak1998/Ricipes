# History
The "Carl Josef" cocktail is a drink with a German origin, reportedly named after a renowned German bartender who crafted the recipe in the early 20th century. Its popularity grew quickly due to its distinctive flavor profile and ease of preparation.

There are two primary recipes associated with the "Carl Josef" name:
1.  **The Gin-Based "Original" Recipe:** This version is described as light and refreshing, including gin, lemon juice, simple syrup, and soda water.
2.  **The Fruity Vodka/Cherry Liqueur Based Recipe:** This variation offers a blend of fruity flavors with an alcoholic kick, using either vodka, orange liqueur, cranberry juice, and lime juice, or cherry liqueur, champagne, and kirschwasser cherry brandy.

The meaning behind the cocktail's name is directly tied to its supposed creator, the German bartender Carl Josef. Beyond this attribution, no deeper symbolic meaning is widely associated with the drink itself.
