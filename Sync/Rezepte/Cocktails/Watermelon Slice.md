# History
The "Watermelon Slice" cocktail is a recent creation, introduced by IHG Hotels & Resorts, a sponsor of the U.S. Open, at the 2025 tournament.

The name "Watermelon Slice" is a direct nod to tennis, referencing a type of shot that imparts backspin or sidespin to the ball with a sharp, slashing motion. The cocktail was specifically designed with visual appeal and "cocktail virality" in mind, aiming to replicate the success of the U.S. Open's long-standing signature drink, the "Honey Deuce". Its distinctive presentation, served in a neon tennis ball-shaped glass and garnished with a watermelon slice, contributes to its "Instagram-worthy" status.

Historically, the "Watermelon Slice" emerged as a competitor to the "Honey Deuce," which has been the iconic cocktail of the U.S. Open since 2006. It is a limited-edition offering, available at the U.S. Open and certain IHG hotel locations. The drink is also notable for its premium price of $39, which some sources suggest adds to its desirability and perception as a special, elevated experience.
