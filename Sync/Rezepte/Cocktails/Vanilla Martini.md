# History
The Vanilla Martini cocktail is believed to have originated in the United States in the early 2000s. Its exact history is unclear, but it quickly gained popularity due to its distinctive flavor and straightforward recipe.

This cocktail is a variation of the classic martini, characterized by a sweeter and richer taste from the addition of vanilla liqueur. The typical ingredients include vanilla liqueur, vodka, and sometimes lime juice to balance the sweetness. Notably, an early version of the Vanilla Martini from Belvedere Vodka featured Navan, a naturally flavored vanilla liqueur that has since been discontinued.

This recipe, with espresso, vanilla vodka, crème de cacao, and vanilla syrup, is a modern and indulgent take on the Vanilla Martini, blending coffee and vanilla flavors for a rich and aromatic experience. It showcases the versatility of the Martini concept, allowing for creative adaptations with various flavor profiles.
