# History
The Cassis Spritz is a modern cocktail that combines the French classic, Crème de Cassis, with the Italian classic, the Spritz.

Crème de Cassis is a blackcurrant liqueur that has been produced in the Burgundy region of France since the 16th century. It is most famously used in the Kir cocktail, a mix of Crème de Cassis and white wine.

The Spritz, on the other hand, originated in the Veneto region of Italy in the 19th century. The modern version, a mix of prosecco, a bitter liqueur, and soda water, has become a popular aperitif worldwide.

The Cassis Spritz is a recent creation that brings these two traditions together. It is a sweeter and fruitier alternative to the more common Aperol or Campari Spritz, and it has become a popular summer drink in recent years.
