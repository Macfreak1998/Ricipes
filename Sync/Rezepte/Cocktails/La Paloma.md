# History
The La Paloma, which means "the dove" in Spanish, is one of Mexico's most popular cocktails. Its history is a bit hazy, but it is believed to have originated in the town of Tequila, Mexico, in the mid-20th century.

One story credits Don Javier Delgado Corona, the owner of the legendary La Capilla bar, with creating the drink. However, Don Javier himself denied this, so the true origin remains a mystery.

The cocktail is a simple and refreshing mix of tequila, lime juice, and grapefruit soda. It is a beloved drink in Mexico, and it has been gaining popularity around the world in recent years. The name is thought to be a reference to a popular folk song of the same name. The recipe in this file calls for "Paloma," which is a brand of grapefruit soda, highlighting the drink's key ingredient.
