# History
The "Caruso" cocktail is a classic drink named in homage to Enrico Caruso, the celebrated Neapolitan tenor who was prominent in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He was a beloved performer at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York City, and the cocktail's creation in the early 1900s is believed to have capitalized on his widespread fame.

The exact origin of the cocktail has a couple of theories:
*   One theory suggests that Enrico Caruso himself conceived the drink, requesting it from a bartender at the Knickerbocker Hotel in New York City in 1906.
*   Another account places its first preparation around 1903, coinciding with Caruso's debut at the New York theater.

The Caruso cocktail gained recognition, appearing in the initial edition of the official IBA (International Bartenders Association) recipe book. It was also included in notable cocktail guides of its time, such as Hugo R. Ensslin's "Recipe for mixed drinks" from 1916 and Harry Craddock's "The Savoy Cocktail Book" published in 1930.

The cocktail's standard recipe calls for equal parts Dry Gin, Dry Vermouth (sometimes specified as French Vermouth), and Green Crème de Menthe. The preparation involves shaking these ingredients with ice and then straining the mixture into a chilled cocktail glass. Due to its sweetness, it is sometimes suggested as a dessert drink.
