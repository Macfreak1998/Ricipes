# History
The "Gene Tunney cocktail" is named after Gene Tunney, the American professional boxer who held the world heavyweight championship from 1926 to 1928.

The exact origin of the cocktail is somewhat mysterious, but it is believed to have been created in the early 20th century, during the Prohibition era.

The cocktail is characterized as a refreshing and sophisticated drink, known for its perfect balance of sweet and sour flavors. This particular recipe, featuring Orange Juice, Lemon Juice, Dry Vermouth, and Gin, offers a crisp and citrus-forward profile, reflecting the elegance and balance often associated with the cocktail's namesake.
