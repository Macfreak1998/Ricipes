# History
The "Hotel Nacional Special" cocktail originated in the 1930s at the iconic Hotel Nacional de Cuba in Havana, Cuba. This tropical drink quickly became a favorite among the hotel's glamorous clientele, including celebrities and socialites, particularly during the Prohibition era in the United States when Americans flocked to Cuba for legal libations.

The cocktail is a symbol of the "golden age of Cuban cocktails," representing tropical elegance and sophistication. It is often described as a sophisticated, fruity twist on a Daiquiri, designed to evoke the vibrant and luxurious atmosphere of Havana.

While the precise creator is debated among cocktail historians, Wil P. Taylor, the manager of the Hotel Nacional de Cuba, is frequently credited with its invention. Other bartenders, Eddie Woelke and Fred Kaufman, are also sometimes mentioned in connection with its creation. Charles H. Baker's influential 1939 book, "The Gentleman's Companion," specifically credits Wil P. Taylor.

The classic recipe for the Hotel Nacional Special typically features rum (historically Bacardi, with discussions around the use of white versus gold rum), pineapple juice, lime juice, simple syrup, and apricot brandy or liqueur. This particular recipe features White Rum, Apricot Brandy, Pineapple Juice, and Lime Juice, creating a refreshing and fruity tropical drink.
