# History
The "Dubonnet Cocktail" is a classic drink primarily known for its unique blend and its association with royalty. It centers around Dubonnet, a French aromatized wine created in 1846 by Joseph Dubonnet, a Parisian chemist and wine merchant.

Dubonnet's origin is rooted in a competition by the French government to find a palatable way to administer quinine, a bitter anti-malarial drug, to French soldiers in malaria-prone regions. Joseph Dubonnet's solution was to blend quinine with fortified red wine, herbs, and spices, creating a unique and more enjoyable beverage. Initially used for its medicinal properties, it gained popularity as an apéritif.

The drink became popular throughout Europe and the United States, particularly among high society and the ruling class. During Prohibition in the U.S., Dubonnet Rouge could even be legally obtained from pharmacies with a doctor's prescription, contributing to its popularity among the upper class. After World War II, it remained a popular choice, especially among women, and was seen as a symbol of luxury and elegance.

At its core, Dubonnet is a sweet wine apéritif, an alcoholic beverage intended to stimulate the appetite before a meal. The "Dubonnet Cocktail" typically refers to a simple mix of Dubonnet Rouge and gin, often served over ice with a lemon twist. It is famously known as the favorite drink of Queen Elizabeth II and the Queen Mother, with Queen Elizabeth II reportedly enjoying it regularly before lunch. The Queen even awarded a royal warrant to Dubonnet in 2021.
