# History
The "Cuban Special" cocktail does not have a widely documented historical origin or a single, definitive creator. It is likely a less common name, a regional variation, or a house special, paying homage to the rich cocktail culture of Cuba.

The ingredients—White Rum, Lime, Triple Sec, and Pineapple Juice—suggest it is a tropical rum cocktail, possibly a variation of the classic Daiquiri. The Daiquiri, a foundational Cuban cocktail, originated in the late 19th century in the mining town of Daiquirí, Cuba. It was created by American mining engineer Jennings Cox, who, lacking gin, improvised with white rum, sugar, and lime. The Daiquiri gained international fame through its popularization in Havana bars like El Floridita.

The "Cuban Special" likely aims to evoke the vibrant flavors and refreshing qualities associated with Cuban mixology, offering a fruity and balanced profile.
