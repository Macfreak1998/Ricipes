# History
The "Gin Rickey" cocktail boasts a rich history, originating in Washington D.C. in the late 19th century. It is named after Colonel Joe Rickey, a Democratic lobbyist known for his preference for dry drinks.

The drink was first conceived around 1883 at Shoomaker's Bar in Washington D.C., a popular establishment among politicians. Initially, the "Rickey" was made with whiskey (often bourbon or rye) and soda water, with a squeeze of lemon, which was later replaced by lime. The gin version of the cocktail gained popularity about a decade later, in the 1890s, eventually surpassing the original whiskey iteration, much to Colonel Joe Rickey's reported displeasure. The Gin Rickey became a staple at Shoomaker's and subsequently spread throughout the city and beyond. Its popularity surged during the Roaring Twenties and it even received a mention in F. Scott Fitzgerald's iconic novel, *The Great Gatsby*. Washington D.C. now celebrates July as Gin Rickey month.

A "Rickey" is a category of cocktail, similar to a sour, defined by its simple composition of a spirit, lime juice, and carbonated water, with little to no added sugar. The Gin Rickey is characterized by its dry, light, refreshing, and slightly tart taste, making it a popular choice for hot weather. The absence of sugar distinguishes it from sweeter cocktails like the Tom Collins.
