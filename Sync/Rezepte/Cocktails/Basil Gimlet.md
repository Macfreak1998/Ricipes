# History
The "Basil Gimlet" is a modern variation of the classic Gimlet cocktail, which has a rich history rooted in the British Royal Navy. The Gimlet originated in the 19th century as a means to combat scurvy among British sailors during long voyages. To prevent it, sailors were given daily rations of lime juice, which they mixed with gin to make it more palatable. This utilitarian practice led to the creation of the Gimlet.

There are two main theories regarding the origin of the name "Gimlet":
*   **Rear-Admiral Sir Thomas Desmond Gimlette:** The most widely accepted theory attributes the drink's name to Royal Navy surgeon Rear-Admiral Sir Thomas Desmond Gimlette, who suggested combining lime juice with the officers' daily gin ration.
*   **The Tool:** Another credible theory suggests the cocktail was named after a gimlet, a small hand tool used for boring holes, particularly into barrels of spirits on Navy ships. This name might also refer to the drink's "piercing" or sharp effect on the drinker.

The classic Gimlet is traditionally made with gin and lime cordial, with Rose's Lime Cordial being the official mixer due to its historical accessibility.

The "Basil Gimlet" is a contemporary twist on this classic. It incorporates fresh basil, which adds an aromatic, herbaceous, and slightly peppery note to the traditional gin and lime combination. This variation likely emerged as bartenders and cocktail enthusiasts began experimenting with fresh herbs to enhance and diversify classic drink profiles, offering a more complex and fragrant experience than the original.
