# History
The "Pepe cocktail" is a name associated with several distinct cocktails, often referencing a person named Pepe or incorporating pepper as an ingredient. This particular recipe, featuring Lemon Juice, Lime Juice, Triple Sec, Grapefruit Juice, Tequila Blanco, and Cachaça, aligns with a version that combines tequila blanco, cachaça, and grapefruit juice.

While there isn't a single, universally recognized historical origin for a cocktail specifically named "Pepe" with this composition, it is likely a modern creation designed to evoke a vibrant and complex flavor profile. The combination of Tequila Blanco (from Mexico) and Cachaça (from Brazil) creates a unique "Latin American" base, blending the agave notes of tequila with the sugarcane character of cachaça. The addition of lemon, lime, and grapefruit juices, along with triple sec, results in a refreshing, fruity, and subtly complex drink. It is a testament to the creativity in mixology, blending diverse spirits and flavors to create a unique experience.
