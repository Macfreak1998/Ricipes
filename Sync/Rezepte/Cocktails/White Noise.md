# History
The "White Noise" cocktail is a refreshing and slightly sweet, low-alcohol aperitif that originated at the Portland Hunt + Alpine Club. It has been a staple on their menu since the establishment opened and is featured in the 2018 book "Northern Hospitality With The Portland Hunt + Alpine Club" by Briana and Andrew Volk.

The cocktail is known for being a crowd-pleaser, appealing to many due to its delicious taste and lower alcohol content, making it suitable for extended sipping or for those who prefer a less potent drink. It's described as effervescent and aromatic, designed to cleanse the palate.

The grapefruit twist is considered a critical ingredient, as the oils expressed from the peel, carried by the sparkling water, contribute significantly to the drink's overall flavor.
