# History
The "Canchanchara" is a traditional Cuban cocktail with a rich history, originating in Trinidad, Cuba, during the 19th century.

The cocktail was first concocted by Cuban guerrilla fighters, known as mambises, during Cuba's fight for independence from Spanish rule, specifically during the Ten Years' War. It served as a practical and invigorating drink, helping to lift their spirits, combat the tropical heat, and even acting as a medicinal remedy. Some historical accounts also suggest it may have been a drink for field workers on Caribbean sugarcane plantations to endure their demanding days. The original recipe was simple, utilizing readily available local ingredients: aguardiente (a precursor to rum), honey, lime, and water.

The Canchanchara is considered the oldest known Cuban cocktail and is seen as a precursor to more modern Cuban drinks like the Daiquiri and the Mojito. It embodies resilience, tenacity, and the revolutionary spirit of Cuba, linking those who drink it to the island's struggle for freedom. The name "Canchánchara" is thought to come from a native Taíno word, which some suggest may refer to a type of clay pot traditionally used to serve the drink. Today, it is still commonly served in these traditional clay pots or jars, particularly in its city of origin, Trinidad, Cuba.
