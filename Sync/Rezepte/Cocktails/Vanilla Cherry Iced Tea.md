# History
The "Vanilla Cherry Iced Tea cocktail" does not appear to have a specific, documented historical origin as a classic cocktail. Instead, it seems to be a modern variation that combines established cocktail elements and flavor profiles.

The name itself likely draws inspiration from two distinct historical threads in mixology:
*   **"Iced Tea" in Cocktails:** The most famous "iced tea" cocktail, the Long Island Iced Tea, is notable for containing no actual tea. Its name comes from its amber color and sweet taste, resembling iced tea. Tea itself has a long history in alcoholic beverages, dating back to 17th-century punches.
*   **Cherry in Cocktails:** Cherries have been a staple in cocktails for centuries, serving as both a garnish and a flavoring agent. Maraschino cherries emerged in the 19th century and became a symbol of elegance in cocktails.
*   **Vanilla in Drinks:** Vanilla has an ancient history as a flavor, used by the Aztecs and introduced to Europe in the 16th century. Its widespread popularity as a flavor suggests its natural inclusion in various mixed drinks over time.

Therefore, while the "Vanilla Cherry Iced Tea cocktail" itself is likely a contemporary creation, it builds upon a rich history of using tea (or tea-like appearances), cherries, and vanilla as popular and versatile ingredients in the world of cocktails and beverages. This recipe, with vodka, tequila, Havana rum, cherry brandy, gin, lemon juice, vanilla syrup, and soda water, is a complex and flavorful modern interpretation.
