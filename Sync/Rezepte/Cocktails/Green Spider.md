# History
The "Green Spider" cocktail is a vibrant green drink primarily known for its simple composition and striking color. While a specific historical account of its creation is not widely documented, the cocktail's name likely derives from its distinctive green hue.

Traditionally, "Green Spider" cocktails are made with vodka and green crème de menthe. This particular recipe, featuring Vodka, Peppermint Syrup, and Tonic Water, is a modern interpretation. It substitutes green crème de menthe with peppermint syrup, offering a similar minty flavor profile, and uses tonic water for effervescence instead of just soda. The fresh mint sprig garnish further enhances its refreshing character. This variation creates a crisp, minty, and visually appealing drink, perfect for those who enjoy a refreshing and straightforward cocktail.
