# History
The "Flight of Passion" cocktail is a modern creation, specifically invented by Abby Martinie, a brand ambassador for Four Roses bourbon, around 2022. This drink is described as a twist on a "Paper Plane" cocktail, featuring Four Roses Bourbon (or other whiskey), lime juice, Aperol, and passionfruit syrup. Its meaning is tied to its creator's preference for passionfruit and its recent development.

The name "Flight of Passion" cleverly combines two concepts: "Flight" could allude to a "cocktail flight" (a selection of smaller cocktails) or the adventurous spirit of aviation (as in the classic Aviation cocktail), while "Passion" directly references the passion fruit, a key ingredient. The cocktail's vibrant flavors and modern origin make it a refreshing and contemporary choice.
