# History
The Sazerac cocktail, a renowned New Orleans classic, boasts a rich history dating back to the early 19th century. Its origins are largely attributed to Antoine Amédée Peychaud, a Creole apothecary who established his shop in the French Quarter. Around 1838, Peychaud is said to have created the drink by combining his unique aromatic bitters with Sazerac de Forge et Fils cognac brandy, a spirit that also lent its name to the cocktail.

The cocktail's recipe evolved over time. By 1850, its popularity led to the establishment of the Sazerac Coffee House, where the drink was prominently served. A significant change occurred around 1870 when Thomas Handy, who took over the Sazerac Coffee House, substituted the original cognac with American rye whiskey due to a phylloxera epidemic that devastated European vineyards and limited cognac supplies. In 1873, bartender Leon Lamothe further refined the drink by adding a dash of absinthe. However, absinthe was banned in the United States in 1912, leading to its replacement with anise-flavored liqueurs like Herbsaint.

The Sazerac's recipe first appeared in print in William T. "Cocktail Bill" Boothby's 1908 publication, "The World's Drinks and How to Mix Them." In a testament to its enduring legacy and cultural significance, the state of Louisiana officially recognized the Sazerac as the official cocktail of New Orleans in 2008. This recipe, with rye whiskey, Peychaud's Bitters, and simple syrup, is a classic example of this iconic cocktail.
