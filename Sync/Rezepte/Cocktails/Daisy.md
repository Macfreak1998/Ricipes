# History
The "Daisy cocktail" has a rich history, with its name, origin, and meaning evolving over time. The name "Daisy" for the cocktail does not refer to the flower. Instead, it originates from 19th-century slang, where "daisy" was used to describe "something extraordinary." This is also the etymological root of the word "doozy."

The Daisy cocktail first appeared in print in an 1866 novel titled "Gay Life in New York, or Fast Men and Grass Widows" by Henry Llewellyn Williams. Its recipe was later included in Professor Jerry Thomas's influential "How to Mix Drinks" in 1876. While the exact birthplace is debated, some sources suggest Washington, D.C. as its likely origin. Another credible account from 1883 suggests it was created a decade earlier at Fred Eberlin's bar in New York by bartender Frank Haas.

The Daisy is best understood as a category of drink rather than a single, fixed recipe. It is essentially a type of sour cocktail, sweetened with a liqueur or flavored syrup, and often lengthened with soda water. Early versions featured various base spirits like brandy, whiskey, gin, and rum, often sweetened with orange liqueur. The cocktail gained popularity in the 1870s and 1880s, then saw a resurgence in the early 1900s, often as a gin-based drink with grenadine and lime juice, served over crushed ice.

The Daisy cocktail is historically significant as a precursor to several classic cocktails, including the Sidecar and the Margarita. In fact, the Margarita is often considered a "tequila daisy," as "margarita" is the Spanish word for "daisy." A typical Daisy cocktail generally consists of an alcoholic spirit, grenadine, and citrus juice, served with ice. This particular recipe features Gin, Dry Curaçao, Lemon Juice, and Soda Water, making it a refreshing and citrus-forward example of a Gin Daisy.
