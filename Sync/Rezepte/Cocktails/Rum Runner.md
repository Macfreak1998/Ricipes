# History
The Rum Runner cocktail originated in the Florida Keys, specifically at the Holiday Isle Tiki Bar (now the Postcard Inn) in Islamorada. It was created by bartender John "Tiki John" Ebert in the early 1970s, though some sources also suggest the 1950s.

Ebert devised the drink as a way to utilize an excess of rum and various liqueurs he had on hand, including banana liqueur, blackberry liqueur, and grenadine. The cocktail's name pays homage to the "rum runners" of the Prohibition era, who were smugglers that transported illegal alcohol by water, particularly in the Florida Keys and Caribbean.

While recipes can vary, typical ingredients for a Rum Runner include light rum, dark rum, banana liqueur, blackberry liqueur, orange juice, pineapple juice, and a splash of grenadine. The drink quickly became a popular tropical staple, especially in the Florida Keys, where it is widely featured on menus. This recipe, with white rum, dark rum, pineapple juice, lime juice, simple syrup, Angostura bitters, and grenadine, is a classic interpretation of this iconic tropical cocktail.
