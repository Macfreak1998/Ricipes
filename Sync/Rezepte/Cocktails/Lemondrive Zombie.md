# History
The "Lemondrive Zombie" cocktail is a modern and creative drink that does not have a widely documented historical origin. It is a variation of the classic "Zombie" cocktail, with the "Lemondrive" in its name likely referring to a specific brand, a creative element, or a particular flavor profile.

The **Zombie cocktail** was created in 1934 by Donn Beach (Ernest Raymond Beaumont-Gantt) at his Don the Beachcomber restaurant in Hollywood, California. The origin of the name "Zombie" comes from a customer who, after consuming the potent drink, reportedly told Beach that it made him feel like a "zombie" for several days. Beach had initially concocted the drink to help this hungover customer get through a business meeting. The Zombie cocktail is renowned for its high alcoholic content, which is often masked by its fruity taste. Due to its potency, Don the Beachcomber restaurants historically limited customers to two Zombies per person. Donn Beach was known for his secrecy regarding his cocktail recipes, often encoding them to prevent others from replicating his popular drinks.

This "Lemondrive Zombie" recipe features White Rum, Dark Rum, Triple Sec, Lemon Juice, Lime Juice, Grenadine, Orange Juice, and Pineapple Juice. It takes the core elements of a Zombie (multiple rums, fruit juices, and liqueurs) and creates a potent and complex tropical drink. The blend of lemon and lime juices, along with orange and pineapple, contributes to a vibrant citrus and fruity profile, while the grenadine adds sweetness and color. This interpretation offers a rich and flavorful experience, embodying the spirit of the classic Zombie with a unique twist.
