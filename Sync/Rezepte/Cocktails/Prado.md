# History
The Prado is a modern craft cocktail featured by @theeducatedbarfly with the description: "The Prado is essentially a fluffy Margarita that subs Cherry Liqueur for Orange Liqueur and adds egg white (or substitute) in this case I'm doing a modern take using Kirschwasser as opposed to the traditional Maraschino Liqueur, it should be noted that Kirsch is not a liqueur but rather a cherry eue de vie so simple syrup is necessary as the sweetener and it will be a little more tart."

**The Origin:**

The Prado appears in cocktail literature as a tequila variation on classic sour templates. Its name likely references the famous Prado Museum in Madrid, Spain, though the cocktail itself uses Mexican tequila and Swiss/German kirschwasser—reflecting cocktail culture's international character.

**The Formula:**

The Prado is essentially a Margarita with two key modifications:
1. **Cherry liqueur replaces orange liqueur** (either Maraschino or Kirschwasser)
2. **Egg white is added** for texture and foam

This creates what DiMonriva calls a "fluffy Margarita"—the egg white foam softens the drink's tartness and creates an elegant presentation.

**Kirschwasser vs. Maraschino:**

The Educated Barfly's version uses Kirschwasser instead of traditional Maraschino liqueur:

**Traditional Version:**
- **Maraschino Liqueur**: Sweet cherry liqueur from Maraschino cherries, already contains sugar
- Results in sweeter, more delicate cherry flavor

**Modern Version:**
- **Kirschwasser** (Cherry eau de vie): Clear, unsweetened cherry brandy (40-50% ABV)
- Much drier, more intense cherry flavor
- Requires added simple syrup for balance
- Creates "a little more tart" drink as noted

**Why Kirschwasser Works:**

Using kirsch instead of maraschino represents modern bartending's preference for less sweet, more complex flavor profiles. Kirschwasser's intensity pairs beautifully with tequila's earthy agave notes, while egg white softens what could otherwise be an aggressively tart drink.

**The "Fluffy" Description:**

Calling this a "fluffy Margarita" is perfect marketing—it immediately communicates texture (egg white foam), approachability (softer than a standard margarita), and visual appeal (beautiful white foam cap).

**Technique Notes:**

The egg white creates signature silky foam through vigorous shaking. Some bartenders use the "reverse dry shake" method (shake with ice first, strain, then shake again without ice) to maximize foam, though DiMonriva doesn't specify this here.

**Historical Context:**

The Prado belongs to the family of "improved" classic cocktails where bartenders take familiar templates (in this case, the Margarita) and add sophistication through technique (egg white, precise shaking) and interesting ingredient substitutions (kirsch for triple sec).

The Prado demonstrates how classic cocktail templates can be successfully adapted by changing just one or two ingredients, creating drinks that feel familiar yet distinctly different—approachable for Margarita lovers but interesting enough for cocktail enthusiasts seeking something new.
