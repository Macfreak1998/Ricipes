# History
The "Zombie Schumann" cocktail is a specific interpretation of the classic Zombie cocktail, likely created or adapted by Charles Schumann, a renowned German barkeeper and restaurateur.

The original Zombie cocktail is a potent, rum-based tiki drink that first appeared in 1934. It was invented by Donn Beach (born Ernest Raymond Beaumont Gantt) at his Hollywood restaurant, Don the Beachcomber. Legend has it that Beach concocted the drink for a hungover customer who later complained it made him feel like a "zombie" for his entire trip. Due to its high alcoholic content, Don the Beachcomber restaurants famously limited customers to two Zombies per person. The original recipe was complex and often kept secret by Beach, leading to many variations over the years.

Charles Schumann, known for operating Schumann's, one of Germany's most famous bars in Munich, and for authoring influential cocktail books like "American Bar," has significantly contributed to the appreciation of cocktails. His approach often emphasizes classic drinks, and he is known for his rum-based creations that blend white and brown rums. This "Zombie Schumann" recipe, with its complex blend of lemon juice, grenadine, orange juice, cherry heering, white rum, dark rum, and overproof rum, aligns with the characteristics of a potent Zombie and Schumann's known preference for rum-based creations, offering his unique take on this iconic tiki drink.
