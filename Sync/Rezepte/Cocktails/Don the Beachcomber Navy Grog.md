# History
The "Don the Beachcomber Navy Grog" is a classic tiki cocktail with a history rooted in both naval tradition and the mid-20th-century tiki cultural phenomenon.

The term "grog" itself originated in the British Royal Navy in 1740. Vice Admiral Edward Vernon, nicknamed "Old Grog," introduced a mixture of rum and water to his sailors to prevent overindulgence and to make rum rations last longer.

Decades later, in the 1940s, Donn Beach (born Ernest Gantt), the visionary behind the Don the Beachcomber restaurants and a pioneer of the tiki movement, created his own elaborate version of the Navy Grog. His aim was to transform the simple naval drink into an exotic, complex cocktail that embodied the escapist allure of his Polynesian-themed establishments.

Donn Beach's Navy Grog recipe was a sophisticated blend of multiple rums, typically gold Demerara, dark Jamaican, and white Cuban or Puerto Rican rums. It also featured fresh lime juice, white grapefruit juice, a honey mix (honey and water), and club soda. This concoction was traditionally served very cold in a large Old Fashioned glass, often with a distinctive snow cone of shaved ice and a straw, which helped to keep the drink frosty and reduce dilution.

The meaning behind Donn Beach's creation was to offer a robust rum punch, initially dedicated to the "gallant men of the American navy," and later broadened to "all gallant men of all the navies of the world." It represented a significant elevation from the basic sailor's grog, incorporating layers of flavor with citrus and honey, and becoming a cornerstone of the burgeoning tiki cocktail culture.
