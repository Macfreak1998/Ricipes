# History

The "Tarzan" cocktail has two notable historical interpretations. The more contemporary version, which this recipe aligns with, was created in 2012 by Zachary Gelnaw-Rubin while he was a bartender at Dutch Kills in Long Island City, a bar that originated from the renowned Milk & Honey.



This rendition is a highball that typically features gin, Campari, pineapple juice, lemon juice, and simple syrup, often topped with soda water. It is described as a balanced drink with bitter, sweet, and tart notes.



An earlier "Tarzan Cocktail" is linked to Edgar Rice Burroughs, the creator of Tarzan. While it's not definitively confirmed that Burroughs himself invented it, a recipe for an "Edgar Rice Burroughs' Tarzan Special Cocktail" exists, described as a "soft drink bourbon" with a cherry, bearing resemblances to a tiki drink or an Old Fashioned.



This recipe, with gin, Campari, pineapple juice, simple syrup, lemon juice, and soda water, is a classic example of the modern highball version of the Tarzan cocktail, offering a refreshing and complex flavor profile.
