# History
The "Mint Daiquiri" cocktail is a refreshing variation of the classic Daiquiri, distinguished by the addition of fresh mint.

The **Daiquiri cocktail** originated around 1898 in Cuba, credited to American mining engineer Jennings Cox. The drink was named after Daiquirí, a mining town near Santiago de Cuba. The classic Daiquiri is a simple yet iconic cocktail, traditionally made with rum, lime juice, and sugar, offering a refreshing balance of sweet and sour flavors. Its popularity surged in the United States during the 1940s, partly due to its association with notable figures such as Ernest Hemingway and President John F. Kennedy. Over time, variations like the frozen Daiquiri and fruit-flavored versions emerged.

The "Mint Daiquiri" combines the traditional Daiquiri ingredients of white rum, lime juice, and simple syrup with fresh mint, resulting in a cocktail that is both sweet and minty fresh. This particular recipe also includes Cointreau, an orange liqueur, adding another layer of citrus complexity. While the exact origin of this specific variation is less documented than the original Daiquiri, it is a natural evolution, offering a refreshing twist on the classic, often described as being reminiscent of a concentrated Mojito.
