# History

The Storm King cocktail was created by bartender Damon Boelte at his Grand Army bar and restaurant in Brooklyn, New York City. The cocktail is named after the Storm King Art Center, a sculpture park in the Hudson Valley, approximately 60 miles north of New York City.



Boelte was inspired by the autumnal landscape of the Hudson Valley, and the drink reflects earthy honey, baking spices, roasted nuts, and a hint of robust red wine. He developed the cocktail after visiting friends who make nocino (an Italian walnut liqueur) in upstate New York. The Storm King cocktail is considered a spin on a Manhattan, drawing inspiration from both the Rob Roy and Bobby Burns cocktails. It was published in the November/December 2019 issue of Imbibe Magazine.



The cocktail typically features blended Scotch whisky, nocino (Wallnusslikör), Benedictine, and Angostura bitters, often garnished with brandied cherries. This recipe, with blended Scotch, Wallnusslikör, Benedictine, and Angostura bitters, is a classic example of this modern and sophisticated cocktail.
