# History
The "Mai Tai" is a classic cocktail deeply intertwined with Tiki culture, known for its tropical flavors and disputed origins. Its name, "Mai Tai Roa Ae," is Tahitian for "out of this world - the best," an exclamation allegedly made upon tasting the drink.

The most widely accepted origin story credits Victor Bergeron, owner of Trader Vic's in Oakland, California, with inventing the Mai Tai in 1944. Bergeron reportedly created the drink for Tahitian friends, who, after tasting it, exclaimed "Mai Tai Roa Ae!" The original recipe included aged Jamaican rum, fresh lime juice, orgeat syrup (almond syrup), orange curaçao, and a dash of simple syrup, specifically using a 17-year-old Jamaican rum.

However, the true origin is a subject of contention. Donn Beach (Don the Beachcomber), another pioneer of Tiki culture, claimed to have created a similar cocktail called the Q.B. Cooler in 1933. While both men are credited with influencing the golden age of cocktails and Tiki culture, Bergeron maintained the right to the Mai Tai name after legal consideration, and his recipe is more universally recognized as the Mai Tai.

The Mai Tai gained significant popularity after Bergeron introduced it to Hawaii in 1953, where it became a "top tourist tantalizer" and a symbol of the islands. Over time, the recipe evolved, with many bars, including the Royal Hawaiian Hotel, adding pineapple juice, orange juice, and a dark rum float to create the iconic layered look known today.

Beyond its literal translation, the Mai Tai embodies the escapism and exotic allure of Tiki culture, which emerged in America by integrating art, music, and entertainment influenced by various island cultures. It represents a vibrant, tropical experience, often associated with lively bars and colorful cocktails. This particular recipe features Lime Juice, Orgeat, Apricot Liqueur, Simple Syrup, Dark Rum, and Overproof Rum, creating a potent and complex tropical drink.
