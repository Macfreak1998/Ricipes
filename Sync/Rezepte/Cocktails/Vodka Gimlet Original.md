# History
The Vodka Gimlet is a modern adaptation of the classic Gin Gimlet, a cocktail with roots in the 19th-century British Royal Navy.

The original Gimlet was conceived as a medicinal drink to combat scurvy, a debilitating disease caused by vitamin C deficiency that was prevalent among sailors during long voyages. British naval officers would mix Rose's lime juice, the world's first commercially produced fruit concentrate designed to preserve lime juice, with gin or rum to make the citrus intake more palatable for the sailors.

The exact origin of the name "Gimlet" is debated. One popular theory credits Rear-Admiral Sir Thomas Gimlette, a Royal Navy physician who allegedly encouraged his messmates to consume lime juice mixed with gin. Another theory suggests the name comes from a gimlet, a small tool used for piercing. The first printed recipe for the Gimlet appeared in Harry MacElhone's "Harry's ABC of Mixing Cocktails" in 1923.

The Vodka Gimlet emerged much later, primarily in the late 1970s or early 1980s. This variation gained popularity as vodka's consumption surged in the United States, surpassing bourbon as the most popular spirit by 1975, while gin's popularity waned. Bartenders began substituting vodka for gin to cater to changing tastes and offer a more neutral-flavored alternative to the traditional gin-based cocktail. This recipe, with lime juice and vodka, is a classic example of this simple and refreshing cocktail.
