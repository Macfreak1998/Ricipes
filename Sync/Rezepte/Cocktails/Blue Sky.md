# History
The "Blue Sky" is a name given to a variety of cocktails that are blue in color, typically due to the use of blue curaçao. There is no single, definitive recipe for the Blue Sky, and the name is used for everything from shots to martinis.

The version of the Blue Sky described in this recipe is a simple but potent shot containing vodka, tequila, and blue curaçao. Like many other blue cocktails, it became popular in the latter half of the 20th century when brightly colored drinks were in vogue. The name evokes the image of a clear blue sky, and the drink is often associated with parties and celebrations.
