# History
The "Little Wing" cocktail has a somewhat varied history, with at least two distinct versions sharing the same name, both seemingly inspired by music.

This particular "Little Wing" cocktail is a riff on the "Paper Plane" cocktail. This variation is often attributed to Jean-Félix Desfosses, who created it for the World Class Bartender competition in 2016, or presented by "Truffle on the Rocks" as a bourbon cocktail recipe. While its specific naming origin isn't always explicitly stated, the "Paper Plane" cocktail, which it riffs on, was named after the M.I.A. song "Paper Planes." It's plausible that this "Little Wing" also draws inspiration from Jimi Hendrix's song, similar to the Difford's Guide version.

This "Little Wing" typically features bourbon, Aperol, elderflower liqueur (such as St-Germain), and lemon juice. This distinguishes it from the original "Paper Plane" cocktail, which uses Amaro Nonino instead of elderflower liqueur. This recipe features Bourbon/Rye Whiskey, Aperol, Elderflower Liqueur, and Lemon Juice, creating a balanced and herbaceous drink with a citrusy kick.

It is worth noting that another version of the "Little Wing" cocktail was created by Francesco Angotti at Dime Bar in Barcelona, Spain, and was the Spanish BACARDÍ Legacy 2013 winning drink. Angotti named the cocktail after Jimi Hendrix's famous song, aiming to create a flavor that "had wings" and would "make you fly around the world." This version typically includes BACARDÍ Superior rum, Yellow Chartreuse, Fee Brothers Fee Foam, lime juice, sugar syrup, and a dash of absinthe.
