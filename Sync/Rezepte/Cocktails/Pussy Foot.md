# History
The Pussyfoot cocktail, a classic non-alcoholic drink, was created in 1920 by Robert Vermeire at the Embassy Club in London, England. It was named after William E. "Pussyfoot" Johnson, a fervent supporter of Prohibition in the United States.

The cocktail gained popularity during the Prohibition era as speakeasies sought to cater to customers who desired a fun night out without consuming alcohol. It became a symbol of understated elegance and refinement during a time of significant cocktail innovation.

The Pussyfoot is a refreshing blend of citrus juices, typically orange, grapefruit, and lemon, with a dash of grenadine for color and sweetness. It has maintained its appeal as a light, fruity, non-alcoholic option, remaining popular at alcohol-free events or as a milder alternative to stronger drinks. This recipe, with its combination of orange, grapefruit, and lemon juices with grenadine, aligns with the traditional Pussyfoot.
