# History
The Ruby Fizz cocktail is a relatively modern addition to the "Fizz" cocktail family, which itself dates back to the 19th century. While the broader Gin Fizz category has a long history, the Ruby Fizz is considered among the newer concoctions, with one source indicating its origin in New York.

The Ruby Fizz is essentially a variation of the Gin Fizz, distinguished by its vibrant color. Grenadine or raspberry juice is commonly incorporated to impart a pink or "ruby" hue to the cocktail. This recipe, with gin, sloe gin, lemon juice, simple syrup, egg white, and soda water, creates a refreshing and visually appealing drink. The sloe gin further enhances the fruity and slightly tart notes, contributing to the "ruby" character of the cocktail. It's a modern take on a classic style, offering a delightful balance of sweet, sour, and effervescent.
