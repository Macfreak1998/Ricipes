# History
There are two prominent cocktails known as the "Eclipse Cocktail," each with a distinct origin and meaning.

This particular "Eclipse Cocktail" was developed in 2009 by Leo Robitscheck while he was working at PDT (Please Don't Tell) in New York City. This modern "Eclipse Cocktail" gained popularity and was included in "The PDT Cocktail Book" by Jim Meehan in 2011.

Its name derives from its visual resemblance to the color of the moon during an eclipse. The cocktail is characterized by its ingredients: añejo tequila, Aperol, Heering cherry liqueur, fresh lemon juice, and a mezcal float. This combination creates a complex and visually striking drink, with the mezcal float adding an intriguing smoky aroma and flavor.

It is worth noting that an earlier "Eclipse Cocktail" was created by the renowned bartender Harry Craddock to commemorate the 1927 total solar eclipse in Britain, and its recipe was first published in his 1930 "The Savoy Cocktail Book." Craddock's original recipe features sloe gin, dry gin, and grenadine.
