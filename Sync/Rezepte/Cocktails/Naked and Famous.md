# History
The "Naked and Famous" cocktail was created in 2011 by bartender Joaquín Simó at Death & Co. in New York City. It also made its debut on the opening menus of Candelaria in Paris and Teardrop Lounge in Portland, Oregon.

Simó described the drink as "the bastard child born out of an illicit Oaxacan love affair between the classic Last Word and the Paper Plane." The cocktail's name is derived from a lyric in the 1996 song "Tricky Kid" by the British rap artist Tricky, which states, "And everybody wants to be naked and famous." Other interpretations suggest the name could be a nod to the indie electronic band "The Naked and Famous" or the 1994 song of the same name by The Presidents of the United States of America, which delves into the personal cost of fame. The name also playfully references the equal proportions of its ingredients and its bold character, hinting at the world of excess and glamour.

The cocktail itself is known for its complex flavor profile, featuring a "daring dance of smoky, bitter, herbal, and citrus notes." It follows the equal-parts structure of its inspirations, the Last Word and Paper Plane, incorporating mezcal, Yellow Chartreuse, Aperol, and fresh lime juice. The Chartreuse and Aperol are used to balance and sweeten the smoky mezcal, which is a central component of the drink.
