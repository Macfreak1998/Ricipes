# History
The "Coconut Kiss" cocktail appears to be a name applied to several different sweet, often tropical, and sometimes non-alcoholic drink recipes, rather than a single, historically defined cocktail with a clear origin. Its meaning generally evokes a sense of sweetness, tropical flavors, and relaxation or romance.

This particular alcoholic version, the "Hard Truth Distilling Co. 'Coconut Kiss'," is described as sweet and vibrant, ideal for a romantic evening. It is a contemporary creation by Hard Truth Distilling Co.

The name "Coconut Kiss" generally conveys a sense of sweetness and indulgence, a tropical escape, and often romance or enjoyment. The "coconut" element immediately brings to mind tropical locations, relaxation, and exotic flavors.
