# History
Butterbeer is a drink made famous by the *Harry Potter* series of books and films. In the wizarding world, it is a popular beverage served in pubs and enjoyed by characters of all ages. While the Butterbeer in the books is described as having a slight alcoholic content, the versions sold at theme parks and other official venues are typically non-alcoholic.

Interestingly, the concept of "buttered beer" is not entirely fictional. A real-world beverage of the same name existed in Tudor-era England. Recipes from the 16th century describe a drink made from beer, sugar, eggs, nutmeg, cloves, and butter. This historical drink was a warm, spiced, and creamy concoction, quite different from the sweet, butterscotch-flavored soda that is commonly sold as Butterbeer today.

The cocktail recipe here is a modern, alcoholic interpretation of the famous fictional drink, combining the flavors of butterscotch, vanilla, and spice with a mix of rum and vodka.
