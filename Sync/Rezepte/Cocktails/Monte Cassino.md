# History
The "Monte Cassino" cocktail was created in 2010 by bartender Damon Dyer at the Louis 649 bar in New York City. It was the winning entry in a cocktail competition celebrating Benedictine's 500th Anniversary.

The cocktail is named after Monte Cassino, a historic Italian abbey that houses the first establishment of the Benedictine Order, founded by Benedict of Nursia in 529 AD. This name serves as an homage to the monastic origins of two of its key herbal liqueur ingredients: Benedictine and Chartreuse.

The Monte Cassino is considered a "riff" or "modern twist" on the classic "Last Word" cocktail. It typically features rye whiskey, Benedictine, Yellow Chartreuse, and fresh lemon juice. The drink is known for its complex, intriguing, and well-balanced herbaceous flavor profile, harmonizing the herbal notes of Benedictine and Chartreuse with the spice of rye whiskey and the tang of lemon.
