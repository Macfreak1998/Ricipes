# History
The exact history of the "Yellow Boxer" cocktail, particularly in relation to the year 1981, is not clearly documented in available historical records. It is generally considered an "odd tiki" style cocktail that appears in many old cocktail books, often in the tiki section, but its original creation date and specific origin remain unknown.

The cocktail is notable for using tequila instead of the more common rum found in many tiki drinks, and typically includes ingredients like lemon, lime, orange juice, and Galliano. The "1981" in the categories might indicate a specific publication or popularization date for this particular recipe, rather than its initial creation.

This recipe, with lemon juice, lime juice, orange juice, Galliano, and tequila blanco, aligns with the typical ingredients mentioned for the Yellow Boxer. It offers a complex and fruity flavor profile, balancing the citrus notes with the herbal sweetness of Galliano and the distinct character of tequila. It's a testament to the diverse and sometimes obscure creations within the broader tiki and tropical cocktail movements.
