# History
The "Coffee Margarita" is a contemporary twist on the classic Margarita cocktail, incorporating coffee flavors to create a unique drink. It is a modern adaptation that builds upon the foundation of the traditional tequila, lime, and orange liqueur cocktail.

The classic Margarita's origin is "shrouded in mystery and folklore," with numerous disputed claims dating back to the 1930s and 1940s. Some popular origin stories include Carlos "Danny" Herrera (1938), Margarita Sames (late 1940s), Danny Negrete (1936), Francisco "Pancho" Morales (1942), and Don Carlos Orozco (1941). The name "Margarita" itself is Spanish for "daisy," and the cocktail may have evolved from other "daisy" cocktails popular in the early 20th century.

The Coffee Margarita represents an evolution in cocktail culture, where classic recipes are reinterpreted with new ingredients to offer diverse flavor experiences. It combines the beloved tangy and refreshing profile of a Margarita with the rich, often bitter, and aromatic notes of coffee, appealing to those who enjoy both coffee and tequila. It's often described as a "bold, buzzy take" or a "dessert margarita," suitable for various occasions from brunch to after-dinner.
