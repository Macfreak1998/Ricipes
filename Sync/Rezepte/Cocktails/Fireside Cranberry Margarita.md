# History
The Fireside Cranberry Margarita is a modern autumn cocktail created by German Instagram bartender @somersby_de for their fall drinks series. This creative margarita variation combines traditional margarita elements (tequila, orange liqueur, lime) with seasonal autumn ingredients: cranberry, apple cider, and ginger beer.

The cocktail represents the modern trend of adapting classic recipes for seasonal menus. Cranberries are a quintessential autumn and winter fruit in North America and Europe, traditionally associated with Thanksgiving and Christmas. Their tart, slightly bitter flavor pairs beautifully with tequila's earthy agave notes.

The addition of Somersby Apple Cider (a popular European commercial cider) adds sweetness and apple character, while ginger beer provides warming spice and effervescence. This combination creates a more complex, layered drink than a traditional margarita, making it suitable for cooler weather sipping.

The name "Fireside" evokes cozy autumn evenings, positioning this as a cold-weather margarita variation. The rosemary garnish option adds an aromatic, herbaceous element that complements both the cranberry and apple flavors while adding visual appeal.

This cocktail exemplifies how classic templates can be successfully adapted for seasonal drinking, maintaining the recognizable margarita structure while introducing autumn's characteristic flavors.
