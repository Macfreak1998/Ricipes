# History
The Trinidad Sour cocktail was created in 2009 by bartender Giuseppe Gonzalez at the Clover Club in Brooklyn, New York. It is particularly notable for its innovative and unconventional use of Angostura bitters as a primary ingredient, rather than just a few dashes.

The cocktail's name, "Trinidad Sour," is a tribute to Trinidad, the country where Angostura bitters are produced. Its creation was inspired by an earlier drink called the "Trinidad Especiale," which was invented by Italian bartender Valentino Bolognese in 2008 for the Angostura European Cocktail Competition. The Trinidad Especiale used Pisco as its base, while Gonzalez's version opted for rye whiskey.

Despite its current status as a modern classic, the Trinidad Sour initially did not fare well in the 2009 cocktail competition where it was first entered, failing to place in the top ten. However, it eventually gained significant popularity and is now recognized for its bold and complex flavor profile. This recipe, with Angostura bitters, rye whiskey, lemon juice, and orgeat, is a classic example of this modern and influential cocktail.
