# History
The "Gin Fix" is a classic American cocktail with a rich history dating back to the mid-19th century. It first appeared in print in 1841, making it one of the earliest variations of punch served in a small bar glass. The Gin Fix was also featured in Jerry Thomas's influential 1862 "The Bartender's Guide," solidifying its place in cocktail history.

A "Fix" cocktail is defined by its simple yet balanced structure: a base spirit (typically gin, but brandy or rum were also common), a sweetening agent (sugar syrup, liqueur, or sometimes honey), a tangy element (lemon or lime juice), and served over crushed ice with a fruit garnish. It was considered a refreshing drink, bridging the gap between a Sour and a Cobbler. Initially, the primary distinction between a Fix and a Sour was the fruit garnish on the Fix. However, by the 1880s, Sours were typically strained off the ice, while Fixes maintained their crushed ice presentation, and some bartenders began incorporating flavored syrups or liqueurs into Fixes.

Despite its popularity in the 19th century, the Fix gradually faded from prominence as a bar drink, largely overshadowed by other cocktail categories like Sours and Fizzes. This decline was partly due to a shift in 20th-century mixology trends that favored drinks served with whole ice cubes over crushed ice. However, with the contemporary resurgence of interest in vintage cocktails and historical recipes, the Fix is experiencing a renewed appreciation among mixologists and enthusiasts.
