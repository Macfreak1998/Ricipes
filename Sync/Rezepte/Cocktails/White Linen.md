# History

The White Linen cocktail was created in 2008 by bartender Rene Dominguez during a cocktail contest in Sacramento, California. It originated at Ella Dining Room and was further popularized at The Shady Lady Saloon in Sacramento.



The drink quickly became known as the "signature drink of Sacramento" and its popularity spread throughout California and beyond. Its creation was seen as a tribute to Sacramento's "Farm to Fork" identity, emphasizing fresh, local ingredients.



The classic White Linen cocktail typically features gin (often Hendrick's), elderflower liqueur (such as St. Germain), fresh cucumber, lemon juice, simple syrup, and club soda. It is celebrated for its crisp, refreshing, and botanical profile, making it a popular choice for summer. This recipe, with gin, elderflower liqueur, lemon juice, simple syrup, cucumber, and soda water, is a classic example of this modern and refreshing cocktail.
