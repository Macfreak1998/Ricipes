# History
The "Robinson" cocktail appears to be a unique or obscure recipe, as there is no widely documented historical information about a cocktail with this specific name. It is likely a personal creation or a specialty drink from a particular establishment.

The recipe itself is a tropical blend of lime juice, papaya fruit, simple syrup, white rum, and dark rum. This suggests a fruity, refreshing, and rum-forward profile, often prepared as a blended drink with crushed ice. The name "Robinson" could be a reference to a person, a place, or a concept specific to its creator, perhaps evoking a sense of adventure or a desert island theme, reminiscent of Robinson Crusoe. While its specific origins are unknown, it stands as an example of creative mixology outside of the established classic cocktail canon.
