# History
The Saturn is one of the most famous gin-based tiki cocktails, created in 1967 by J. "Popo" Galsini, a bartender at Palms In The Jungle restaurant in Anaheim, California. It was his winning cocktail in that year's International Bartender's Association World Championship.

Originally named "X-15" after the American rocket plane, Galsini renamed his creation "Saturn" when one of the X-15 planes crashed, killing its pilot. The name change reflected the space age optimism of the 1960s while honoring the fallen pilot.

Though rum dominates tiki culture, gin has a long-standing presence in tropical drinks, and the Saturn has become one of the most enduring examples. The cocktail combines gin's botanical character with the tropical flavors of passion fruit and the sweet, nutty notes of orgeat and falernum, creating a fruity but complex drink.

Originally served in a blended form with a thick, almost slushy consistency, the Saturn is now more commonly shaken and poured over pebble or crushed ice for a cleaner, more modern presentation. However, the blended version remains the classic preparation.

The Saturn continues to appear on bar menus worldwide. At Slowly Shirley in New York City, bartender Garret Richard uses Beachbum Berry's Latitude 29 formula orgeat for a "lighter and more floral style." The drink represents the creative potential of gin in tiki cocktails and remains one of the most searched cocktail recipes online.
