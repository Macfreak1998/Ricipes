# History
The Wodka Sour (Vodka Sour) is a modern adaptation of the classic sour cocktail, which has roots dating back to the mid-19th century. Sour cocktails traditionally combine a spirit, citrus (often lemon or lime), and a sweetener. Early examples include the Whiskey Sour and Gin Sour, with the first written sour cocktail recipes appearing in Jerry Thomas's 1862 "The Bartender's Guide."

The Vodka Sour itself came into prominence in the latter half of the 20th century, particularly during the 1960s and 1970s, as vodka's popularity surged globally and it became a mainstream spirit. Bartenders began substituting vodka into existing sour templates, creating this new variation. While there isn't a single inventor, its emergence reflects the evolving preferences of drinkers and vodka's versatility as a neutral base spirit.

The cocktail typically consists of vodka, fresh lemon juice, and simple syrup, often shaken with ice. Optional additions include egg white (or foamer, as in this recipe) for a silky texture and frothy top, and Angostura bitters for added complexity and depth. The Vodka Sour is celebrated for its crisp, refreshing, and adaptable nature, making it a staple in modern mixology. This recipe, with vodka, lemon juice, simple syrup, and foamer, is a classic example of this popular and refreshing cocktail.
