# History
The "Lone Tree cocktail," a classic gin-based drink often considered a variation of the Martini, originated in the early 20th century. Its earliest known appearances were in "The Cocktail Book, A Sideboard Manual for Gentleman" in 1900 and Applegreen's Bar Book in 1913. The cocktail was also featured in Jacques Straub's 1914 book "Drinks" and Albert Stevens Crockett's 1931 classic "Old Waldorf Bar Days."

The cocktail derives its name from the renowned Lone Tree bar in New York City. This establishment was celebrated for its elegant ambiance, sophisticated patrons, and innovative drink creations, making it a popular spot among the city's elite during the 20th century.

Characterized by a well-balanced blend of sweet, sour, and bitter notes, the Lone Tree cocktail offers a smooth, velvety texture with subtle hints of citrus and herbs. It leaves a lingering, slightly bitter aftertaste. Due to its refined and sophisticated flavor profile, it is sometimes referred to as the "Gentleman's Martini." This particular recipe features Dry Vermouth, Sweet Vermouth, Orange Bitters, and Gin, creating a balanced and elegant Martini variation.
