# History
The "Rose English" cocktail, often referred to as the "English Rose," is a classic drink with a history that is somewhat debated but generally points to an early 20th-century origin. Some sources suggest it dates back to the early 1900s and was potentially created by the renowned bartender Harry Craddock, who worked at the Savoy Hotel in London.

This cocktail is often characterized as a delightful variation of the classic gin martini, known for its sweeter profile. It typically combines gin, apricot brandy (or apricot liqueur), dry vermouth, lemon juice, and grenadine. The name "English Rose" evokes a sense of classic English charm and the floral notes that can be present in some versions of the drink.

This recipe, with gin, dry vermouth, apricot liqueur, lemon juice, and grenadine, aligns with the classic structure of this enduring cocktail, offering a balanced and subtly fruity gin-based drink.
