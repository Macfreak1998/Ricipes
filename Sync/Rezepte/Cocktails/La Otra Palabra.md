# History
The cocktail "La Otra Palabra" is a modern variation, or "riff," on the classic "The Last Word" cocktail. It was created by Eric Alperin. The name "La Otra Palabra" translates from Spanish to "The Other Word," directly referencing its predecessor. Another similar mezcal-based variation, "La Ultima Palabra" (meaning "The Last Word" in Spanish), is attributed to Simone De Luca.

Historically, "The Last Word" cocktail was invented at the Detroit Athletic Club in the early 1900s and gained popularity in the New York City scene through vaudeville performer Frank Fogarty. Its recipe first appeared in print in Ted Saucier's 1951 cocktail book, "Bottoms Up."

"La Otra Palabra" typically substitutes the gin found in "The Last Word" with mezcal, giving it a smoky, agave-forward profile. The common ingredients for "La Otra Palabra" include mezcal, lime juice, yellow chartreuse, maraschino liqueur, and agave syrup.
