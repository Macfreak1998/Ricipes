# History
The "Cannonball" cocktail does not refer to a single, universally recognized drink, but rather several distinct recipes that share the name. This particular Mezcal-based "Cannonball" was created by Beau du Bois of Puesto Mexican Artisan Kitchen & Bar in San Diego. It is described as a Mexican-inspired twist on the Hotel Nacional cocktail. The name likely alludes to the bold, smoky flavor of mezcal harmonizing with the apricot and pineapple.

The word "cannonball" itself originates from "cannon" + "ball," referring to an iron ball shot from a cannon (1660s). It also describes a type of dive, named for its shape, dating from 1905. While not directly tied to this specific cocktail's origin, the term evokes a sense of impact, force, or a "splash," which could be an underlying inspiration for naming various potent or flavorful drinks "Cannonball."
