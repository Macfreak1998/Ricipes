# History
The "Snoopy" cocktail is a fruity variation of a classic Boulevardier or an Old Fashioned, named in honor of the imaginative beagle from Charles M. Schulz's beloved "Peanuts" comic strip.

The Snoopy cocktail first appeared in the "Jones Complete Cocktail Guide of 1970" (with some sources suggesting 1971 for the original edition). This makes it a relatively rare and obscure find, with the book itself being quite uncommon. Cocktail historian Philip Greene suggests honoring the "Peanuts" gang with this cocktail. Recently, some New York City bars have been revitalizing this classic drink, bringing it back to their menus.

The cocktail's name directly references Snoopy, the iconic character from the "Peanuts" comic strip, which ran for 50 years until its creator's death in 2000. The drink is seen as a way to celebrate the cherished characters of the comic. Its flavor profile has been described as a "strange, orange creamsicle riff on an Old Fashioned."
