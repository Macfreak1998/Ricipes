# History
The Passoa Sour is a modern adaptation of the classic "sour" cocktail formula, which typically combines a spirit, citrus juice, and a sweetener. The history of sour cocktails dates back centuries, with early versions often using rum or brandy.

The key ingredient in the Passoa Sour is Passoa, a passion fruit liqueur that was created in 1985 by Rémy Cointreau in France. Inspired by the tropical flavors of the French Caribbean, Passoa was launched in Europe in 1986 and quickly gained popularity for its vibrant passion fruit flavor.

The Passoa Sour emerged as a natural evolution, leveraging Passoa's inherent sweet and tart profile within the traditional sour structure. It combines Passoa with lemon juice and simple syrup, often with the addition of an egg white or foamer for a creamy texture. While it doesn't have a long, documented history, it is a popular contemporary cocktail that showcases the versatility of passion fruit liqueur.
