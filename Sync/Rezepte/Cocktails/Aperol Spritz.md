# History
The Aperol Spritz is a popular Italian cocktail with a rich history rooted in both Austrian tradition and Italian innovation.

The term "Spritz" dates back to the 19th century when parts of Northern Italy were under the control of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Austrian soldiers, finding local wines too strong, began diluting them with a splash of water, a practice they called "spritzen" (to splash). This laid the groundwork for the modern spritz, which evolved to include soda water and various liqueurs.

The Aperol liqueur itself was created in Padua, Italy, in 1919 by brothers Luigi and Silvio Barbieri. They spent seven years perfecting its unique recipe, which includes bitter and sweet oranges and rhubarb, and debuted it at the 1919 Padova World Fair. The name "Aperol" is derived from the French word "apéritif," reflecting its intended use as a pre-dinner drink.

The Aperol Spritz, as it is known today, emerged in the 1950s in Northern Italy. Its popularity soared after a 1950s TV advertisement showcased its recipe. The cocktail's global recognition significantly increased after the Campari Group acquired Aperol in 2003, launching extensive marketing campaigns that popularized the "3-2-1" recipe: three parts Prosecco, two parts Aperol, and one part soda water, garnished with an orange slice.

The Aperol Spritz is often described as an "Italian sunset in a glass" due to its vibrant orange hue. It embodies the Italian tradition of *aperitivo*, a low-alcohol, pre-dinner drink meant to refresh and stimulate the appetite. Beyond its role as an appetite stimulant, it has come to symbolize shared pleasure and a relaxed, social lifestyle, particularly during summer evenings.
