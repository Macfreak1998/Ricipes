# History
The "French 68" cocktail is a variation of the more widely known "French 75" cocktail, often featuring an apple aroma or incorporating brandy and Calvados. While the "French 68" itself doesn't have a distinct, well-documented historical origin separate from its predecessor, its characteristics are derived from the "French 75."

The "French 68" typically combines brandy (sometimes Calvados brandy for the apple notes), grenadine syrup, sugar syrup, lemon juice, and champagne. It is described as an elegant and sparkling drink, perfect for celebrations, offering a blend of rich and refreshing flavors.

The history and meaning largely stem from the "French 75" cocktail, which has a rich and somewhat debated past:
*   **Origin of the French 75:** The "French 75" cocktail is believed to have originated around World War I. An early form of the drink was created in 1915 at the New York Bar in Paris (later Harry's New York Bar) by barman Harry MacElhone.
*   **The Name's Meaning:** The cocktail is named after the French 75-millimeter field gun (Canon de 75 modèle 1897), a powerful and rapid-fire artillery piece used by the French army during WWI. The drink was said to have such a potent kick that it felt like being hit by a shell from this gun.
*   **Evolution of the Recipe:** Early recipes for the "French 75" varied. The now-classic form of the "French 75," consisting of gin, sugar, lemon juice, and champagne, appeared in *Here's How* by Judge Jr. in 1927. Some later versions, like those popularized at the Stork Club in New York, used cognac instead of gin.

In essence, the "French 68" is a modern interpretation or variation that builds upon the established foundation and historical significance of the "French 75" cocktail, offering a similar sparkling and celebratory experience with a slightly different flavor profile, often emphasizing brandy or Calvados.
