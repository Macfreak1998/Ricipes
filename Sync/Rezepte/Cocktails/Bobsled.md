# History
The "Bobsled" cocktail, as presented in this recipe, is a tropical drink that combines Jamaican rum, Fernet, pineapple juice, lime juice, and simple syrup. This particular rendition is explicitly named after the 1993 film "Cool Runnings," which tells the story of the Jamaica national bobsleigh team's debut at the 1988 Winter Olympics.

The meaning behind this cocktail's name is a direct homage to the film and the Jamaican bobsled team, reflecting a blend of unexpected elements—the funky Jamaican rum and the herbaceous, bitter Fernet—much like the bobsled team itself. This version aims to create a balanced drink where the strong flavors of Jamaican rum and Fernet are complemented by the sweetness of pineapple and lime.
