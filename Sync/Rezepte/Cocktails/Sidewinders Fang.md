# History
The Sidewinder's Fang is a classic tiki cocktail that originated in the 1960s at the Lanai Restaurant in San Mateo, California. This period was marked by a vibrant tiki culture, where exotic drinks and tropical themes were highly popular.

The talented bartenders at the Lanai Restaurant crafted the Sidewinder's Fang as a tribute to the fun and adventure associated with tiki culture, and it quickly became a hit among patrons. It was a common sight at many mid-century Polynesian restaurants and bars.

The cocktail is known for its citrus-forward, tart, and refreshing flavors, offering a modest bite rather than an overpowering boozy taste. A key characteristic of the Sidewinder's Fang is its whimsical garnish: a snake head-shaped orange peel, which is a playful nod to the drink's name and adds to its tiki flair. This recipe, with lime juice, orange juice, passion fruit syrup, blended aged rum, and black blended rum, is a classic example of this iconic tiki cocktail.
