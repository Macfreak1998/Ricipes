# History
The Bushwhacker is a frozen cocktail that was invented in 1975 at the Ship's Store, Sapphire Pub at Sapphire Village in St. Thomas, US Virgin Islands. The cocktail's name has a charming origin story: there was a beloved dog that frequented the village named "Bushwack," and the bartenders decided to name their new creamy, frozen creation after the popular canine. The rest, as they say, is history.

The original 1975 recipe called for vodka, Kahlúa, dark crème de cacao, Coco Lopez (cream of coconut), a splash of triple sec, and milk, all blended with ice and topped with a grating of fresh nutmeg. This combination created a rich, chocolate-coconut drink that quickly became a hit among tourists and locals alike.

Over the decades, the recipe has evolved, with most modern versions substituting dark rum for vodka, which gives the drink a more Caribbean character and pairs better with the coconut and chocolate flavors. The drink is similar to a creamy, chocolate-infused piña colada, offering a decadent dessert-like cocktail experience.

The Bushwhacker gained particular popularity along Florida's Gulf Coast, where it became a staple at beach bars and waterfront restaurants. The famous Flora-Bama Lounge on the Alabama-Florida border became legendary for their version, serving them by the thousands to beachgoers.

The cocktail experienced a resurgence in popularity in 2024, becoming one of the most searched and ordered frozen cocktails of the year. Its appeal lies in its dessert-like qualities—combining the flavors of chocolate, coconut, and coffee into a creamy, indulgent drink that's perfect for hot weather and vacation vibes.

While it's often dismissed as a "foo-foo drink," the Bushwhacker has earned its place in tiki and tropical cocktail canon. It represents the evolution of American beach bar culture and the Caribbean's influence on frozen cocktail traditions. Some bartenders have elevated the drink by using high-quality ingredients, fresh coconut cream, and artisanal chocolate liqueurs, proving that even crowd-pleasing frozen drinks can be crafted with care.
