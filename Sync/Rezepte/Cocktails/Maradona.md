# History
The "Maradona" cocktail, as presented in this recipe, is a modern and creative drink that does not have a widely documented historical origin. The name "Maradona" is a clear homage to the legendary Argentine footballer, Diego Armando Maradona, a figure who embodied passion, fierceness, and a magnetic personality. While the most common "Maradona cocktail" is a blue "Maradona Spritz," this recipe offers a distinct interpretation.

This particular recipe features Heavy Cream, Passion Fruit Juice, and Passion Fruit Syrup. It creates a creamy, sweet, and intensely fruity drink, highlighting the tropical flavors of passion fruit. The absence of alcohol in this recipe (or a very low ABV if the cream is alcoholic) suggests it's designed as a refreshing and indulgent treat, perhaps a nod to the celebratory and joyful spirit associated with Maradona's legacy. It is a unique and flavorful concoction that captures a vibrant and tropical essence.
