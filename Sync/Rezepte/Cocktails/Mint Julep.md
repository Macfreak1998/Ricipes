# History
The "Mint Julep" cocktail boasts a rich history, evolving from ancient medicinal concoctions to an iconic symbol of the American South and the Kentucky Derby.

**Origin of the Name and Early History:**
The word "julep" originates from the Persian word "gulab," meaning rosewater. In ancient Persia, juleps were initially medicinal syrups made with rose petals and water, used to mask the bitter taste of medicine and as health elixirs. As the concept spread to the Mediterranean, mint, due to its abundance, began to replace rose petals in these preparations.

The medicinal julep made its way to America in the 18th century. Here, it transformed into a morning tonic, typically a mixture of spirits (often rum or brandy), sugar, water, and mint. An early written reference from 1803 by Englishman John Davis described it as "a dram of spirituous liquor that has mint in it, taken by Virginians of a morning."

**Southern Identity and Bourbon:**
By the early 19th century, the Mint Julep became deeply intertwined with Southern gentility and hospitality. The rise of bourbon production in Kentucky led to it replacing rum and brandy as the primary spirit in the cocktail, solidifying its place in Southern, particularly Kentuckian, culture.

**Meaning and Association with the Kentucky Derby:**
The Mint Julep is most famously associated with the Kentucky Derby, becoming its official cocktail in 1938. This association has elevated it to a symbol of elegance, tradition, and cultural heritage. During the Kentucky Derby weekend, approximately 120,000 Mint Juleps are served. Traditionally, the drink is served in a frosty silver cup, which allows ice to form on the outside, enhancing the cooling sensation and overall experience.

This particular recipe features Rye Whiskey, Simple Syrup, a Sugar Cube, and Fresh Mint, creating a classic and refreshing julep.
