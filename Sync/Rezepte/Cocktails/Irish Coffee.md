# History
The "Irish Coffee" cocktail originated in the winter of 1943 at Foynes Airbase in County Limerick, Ireland. Joe Sheridan, a chef at the airport's restaurant, created the drink to warm a group of transatlantic flight passengers whose flight to New York had to turn back due to severe weather.

The drink consists of hot coffee, Irish whiskey, sugar, and a layer of fresh cream floated on top. When a passenger asked if the coffee was Brazilian, Sheridan famously replied, "No, that's Irish Coffee," thus giving the drink its name.

The Irish Coffee gained international recognition when travel writer Stanton Delaplane encountered it in Ireland in the 1950s. He brought the recipe back to San Francisco, where he worked with Jack Koeppler, the owner of the Buena Vista Café, to perfect the method of floating the cream. The Buena Vista Café is credited with introducing Irish Coffee to America and continues to serve thousands of them daily.

Beyond its ingredients, Irish Coffee has come to symbolize warmth, hospitality, and a rich cultural tapestry of Ireland. This particular recipe features Irish Whiskey, Cinnamon Syrup, Hot Coffee, and Cold Heavy Cream, offering a comforting and aromatic twist on the classic.
