# History
The "Hole in the Cup" cocktail was created by Lauren McLaughlin, who was the Head Bartender at Fresh Kills in Brooklyn and previously worked at the renowned Milk & Honey in New York City.

The cocktail's origin lies in its inspiration as a variation of Sasha Petraske's "Gordon's Cup," which itself was a reimagining of the classic "Pimm's Cup." McLaughlin's unique twist involved adding absinthe and pineapple to the existing concept, leading to a distinct flavor profile.

The name "Hole in the Cup" refers to how quickly patrons would consume the drink, indicating its delicious and refreshing nature despite the inclusion of absinthe. It quickly became a favorite among staff and guests due to its well-balanced and complex blend of flavors. The cocktail is characterized by its refreshing and complex taste, combining blanco tequila, absinthe, pineapple juice, lime juice, simple syrup, and muddled cucumber.
