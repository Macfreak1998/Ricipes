# History
The "Brown Derby" cocktail is a classic drink with a rich history tied to Hollywood's Golden Age. It typically consists of bourbon, grapefruit juice, and honey syrup, offering a balance of sweet and tart flavors.

The cocktail is believed to have been created in the 1930s at the Vendôme Club on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles, an establishment owned by *Hollywood Reporter* founder Billy Wilkerson. Despite its creation at the Vendôme Club, the drink was named after the iconic Brown Derby restaurant, a popular social hub for Hollywood's elite, known for its distinctive has-shaped architecture.

There is some debate regarding the cocktail's exact origin, as a very similar recipe, called the "De Rigueur cocktail," appeared in Harry Craddock's 1930 *The Savoy Cocktail Book*. Some sources suggest the Brown Derby recipe might have been inspired by or even copied from the "De Rigueur."

The "Brown Derby" cocktail is more than just a drink; it's a symbol of the glamour and celebrity culture of 1930s Hollywood. Its name evokes the legendary Brown Derby restaurant, where movie stars and industry figures frequently gathered. The cocktail's enduring appeal lies in its connection to this opulent era, offering a taste of old-school Hollywood charm. It's considered a timeless classic that bridges the present with the past, reflecting a bygone era of sophistication.
