# History
The "Presbytarian" cocktail is almost certainly a misspelling of the "Presbyterian" cocktail, a classic highball believed to have originated in the late 1890s.

The drink is typically made with whiskey (often Scotch or rye), ginger ale, and sometimes a splash of club soda. The exact origin of its name is not definitively known, but it has been associated with the drink for over a century. One theory suggests the name might come from "presbýteros," the Greek word for 'elder,' linking it to the Presbyterian Church. Another less substantiated explanation posits that the name is younger than the drink itself, stemming from a mocktail of ginger ale and soda served to teetotaling Presbyterians at 1950s cocktail parties.

By 1900, a variation of the Presbyterian emerged with the addition of lime, becoming known as the Mamie Taylor. This addition of lime juice made the Mamie Taylor a very popular and more balanced drink. The Presbyterian remains a simple, refreshing, and enduring classic.
