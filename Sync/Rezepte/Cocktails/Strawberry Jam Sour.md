# History
The Strawberry Jam Sour is a modern craft cocktail created by Instagram bartender @my_cocktail_bible, representing the contemporary trend of using pantry ingredients—specifically preserves and jams—in cocktails. This approach makes craft cocktails more accessible to home bartenders while adding unique flavor and texture.

**The Jam Revolution:**

Using jam or preserves in cocktails has become increasingly popular in the 2010s-2020s for several reasons:

1. **Accessibility**: Most people have jam in their pantry, making this easier than sourcing specialized syrups or liqueurs
2. **Flavor Complexity**: Quality jams contain real fruit, sugar, and sometimes pectin, creating more complex flavor than simple fruit syrups
3. **Texture**: Jam adds body and a subtle thickness to cocktails that enhances mouthfeel
4. **Versatility**: Any jam flavor can be adapted to this template

**The Gin Sour Template:**

This cocktail follows the classic gin sour formula (gin + citrus + sweetener + egg white) but replaces traditional simple syrup with strawberry jam. The jam provides both sweetness and intense strawberry flavor, creating a drink that tastes more authentically "strawberry" than most strawberry liqueurs.

The egg white creates the characteristic silky foam top that defines modern sours, providing both visual appeal and textural contrast. The foam also acts as a canvas for the dehydrated blood orange garnish, creating an Instagram-worthy presentation.

**Technique Note:**

When using jam in cocktails, vigorous shaking is essential to fully incorporate the preserves and break down any fruit pieces. Many bartenders recommend a reverse dry shake (shake with ice first, then strain and shake again without ice) to maximize foam, though a standard shake works well too.

**The Blood Orange Garnish:**

The dehydrated blood orange slice provides visual drama with its deep red color, creating a beautiful contrast against the white foam and pale pink drink. It also adds an aromatic citrus element when the drink is brought to the nose.

This cocktail exemplifies modern bartending's focus on approachable ingredients and techniques while maintaining the sophistication and balance of classic cocktail templates.
