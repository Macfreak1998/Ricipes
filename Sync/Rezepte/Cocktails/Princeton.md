# History
The Princeton Cocktail is a classic drink with a history dating back to the late 19th century. It first appeared in George J. Kappeler's 1900 *Modern American Drinks*. The cocktail was created by New York barman George Kappeler at the Holland House bar, where he also mixed other Ivy League-named drinks, likely to appeal to alumni patrons and enhance the bar's sophisticated image.

The original Princeton Cocktail recipe typically includes Old Tom gin, orange bitters, and port wine. A distinctive feature of the drink is its two-toned appearance, achieved by carefully pouring the port so it settles at the bottom of the glass, creating a layered effect. While some recipes suggest stirring all ingredients together, the layered presentation remains a notable characteristic.

This recipe, with brandy, white port, and orange bitters, is a variation of the classic, adapting the base spirit and type of port while maintaining the elegant simplicity of the original.
