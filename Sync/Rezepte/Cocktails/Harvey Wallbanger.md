# History
The "Harvey Wallbanger" is a mixed drink consisting of vodka, Galliano, and orange juice, often considered a variation of the screwdriver.

Its origin is steeped in a popular, though likely fabricated, myth. According to this story, the cocktail was named after a surfer named Tom Harvey. After a disappointing loss in a surfing competition, Harvey reportedly frequented a bar, consuming numerous orange juice and vodka drinks laced with Galliano. In his frustration, he allegedly banged his head against a wall, leading to the drink's memorable name.

A more plausible origin credits the cocktail to Donato "Duke" Antone, a three-time world champion mixologist. He is said to have created a similar drink, possibly called "Duke's Screwdriver," which contained vodka, orange juice, and Galliano. Antone either ran Duke's Blackwatch Bar in Hollywood in 1952 or a bartending school in Hartford, Connecticut.

The Harvey Wallbanger gained widespread popularity in the early 1970s, largely due to a successful marketing campaign by George Bednar, the marketing director for McKesson Imports Co., which imported Galliano. This campaign featured a cartoon surfer character named Harvey Wallbanger, whose tagline was, "Harvey Wallbanger is the name, and I can be made!" This marketing effort solidified the drink's identity and contributed to its status as a cultural phenomenon. The name's meaning is thus directly tied to this fictional character and the humorous, albeit apocryphal, story of his frustration.
