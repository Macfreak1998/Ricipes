# History
The "Brandy Alexander" is a classic, sweet, and creamy dessert cocktail with a history tracing back to the early 20th century. It is a variation of an older cocktail simply called the "Alexander," which originally used gin instead of brandy. The switch from gin to brandy likely occurred in the early 1900s, giving the drink a richer flavor.

The exact origin and naming of the Brandy Alexander are subject to several theories:
*   One popular theory credits Troy Alexander, a bartender at Rector's restaurant in New York City, who may have created it for a dinner celebrating Phoebe Snow, a fictional advertising character known for her white attire. The cocktail's white appearance matched her image.
*   Other speculations suggest it was created for the 1922 London wedding of Princess Mary and Viscount Lascelles, or named after drama critic Alexander Woollcott, or even Russian Tsar Alexander II.

The Brandy Alexander gained significant popularity in the early to mid-20th century, particularly in the United States. Its rise coincided with the Prohibition era (1920-1933), and some believe its creamy, sweet nature helped mask the taste of lower-quality spirits available at the time. It became a fashionable after-dinner drink, often enjoyed in high-end establishments, and was a staple on cocktail menus through the mid-20th century.

Culturally, the Brandy Alexander is recognized as an indulgent, dessert-like drink. It has appeared in various forms of popular culture, including literature, film, and television. Notably, John Lennon was a fan of the drink, reportedly calling them "milkshakes." While its popularity waned in the late 20th century, it has experienced a resurgence in the 21st century as classic cocktails became trendy again.
