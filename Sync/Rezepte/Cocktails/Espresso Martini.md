# History
The "Espresso Martini," a popular cold caffeinated alcoholic cocktail, has a well-documented history, originating in London in the mid-1980s.

The cocktail was created by the late British bartender Dick Bradsell. The most common account states that Bradsell invented the drink around 1983 at the Soho Brasserie in London. The inspiration came from a supermodel, rumored to be Kate Moss, who approached him and requested a drink that would "wake me up and f*** me up." Bradsell, with a coffee machine conveniently located near his bar station, combined fresh espresso with vodka, coffee liqueur (such as Kahlúa), and sometimes sugar syrup, shaking it and serving it in a martini glass.

Initially, Bradsell's creation was known as the "Vodka Espresso" and was briefly called the "Pharmaceutical Stimulant." The name "Espresso Martini" was adopted later, influenced by the trend in the 1990s to refer to any cocktail served in a V-shaped glass as a "martini," despite the drink containing neither gin nor vermouth, which are traditional martini ingredients. The drink's popularity surged globally, especially with the rise of coffee culture and a demand for sophisticated cocktails.

The Espresso Martini is traditionally garnished with three coffee beans placed on top of its creamy head. These three beans are symbolic, representing health, wealth, and happiness. This tradition is rooted in Italian culture, where the number three holds significance, often associated with faith and luck.
