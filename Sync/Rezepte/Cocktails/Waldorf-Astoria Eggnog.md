# History
While a definitive historical account of the "Waldorf-Astoria Eggnog" cocktail originating specifically at the Waldorf-Astoria hotel is not explicitly detailed in available records, the cocktail is recognized as an elegant variation of the classic eggnog recipe. The Waldorf-Astoria hotel is known for originating or popularizing several classic dishes and cocktails, such as the Waldorf salad, Eggs Benedict, the Waldorf cocktail, Rob Roy, and Bronx.

The Waldorf-Astoria Eggnog is described as an elegant twist on traditional eggnog, featuring a rich blend of bourbon, red port, and creamy milk. It typically includes egg yolks, sugar syrup, Tawny Port, bourbon, milk, and cream, garnished with nutmeg. The preparation involves shaking the ingredients well over ice and straining into a highball glass, then sprinkling with nutmeg. This sophisticated drink has a light golden hue with a frothy top and a warm, spiced aroma from the nutmeg, balancing smooth creaminess with the subtle sweetness of port and the depth of bourbon.

This recipe, with egg yolk, simple syrup, red port wine, bourbon, and heavy cream, is a classic example of this rich and festive cocktail, embodying the luxurious style often associated with the Waldorf-Astoria name.
