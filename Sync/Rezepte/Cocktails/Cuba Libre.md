# History
The "Cuba Libre" cocktail, meaning "Free Cuba," is a drink deeply intertwined with Cuban history and its struggle for independence.

The Cuba Libre cocktail originated in Havana, Cuba, around 1900, shortly after the Spanish-American War concluded in 1898 and Cuba gained its independence. The availability of bottled Coca-Cola, which began being imported into Cuba around 1900, made the creation of this drink possible.

A widely accepted story attributes its creation to a U.S. Army Signal Corps captain. While celebrating Cuba's victory at a bar in Havana, he reportedly mixed Cuban rum (traditionally Bacardi), Coca-Cola, and a squeeze of fresh lime. He then raised a toast, exclaiming "¡Por Cuba Libre!" (For a Free Cuba), a phrase that was a powerful battle cry for Cuban revolutionaries and American soldiers alike during the war. This toast is said to have given the drink its enduring name. It's worth noting that the term "Cuba Libre" as a drink existed earlier, during the Ten Years' War (1868-1878), referring to a concoction of honey or molasses and water, sometimes with aguardiente. However, the modern cocktail we know today emerged with the introduction of Coca-Cola.

The name "Cuba Libre" directly translates to "Free Cuba" in Spanish. It symbolizes the island nation's hard-won independence from Spanish rule and embodies a spirit of freedom and camaraderie.

The classic Cuba Libre is a simple highball cocktail consisting of rum (traditionally Cuban light rum, such as Bacardi), cola (most commonly Coca-Cola), and fresh lime juice or a lime wedge for garnish. The addition of lime is considered a crucial element that distinguishes a Cuba Libre from a generic "Rum & Coke," providing a tart, citrusy balance to the sweetness of the cola and rum.
