# History
The "Cobbler" cocktail is a classic American drink with a rich history, believed to have originated in the early 19th century. Its exact creator remains unknown, but it rose to prominence in the 1830s, with the Sherry Cobbler becoming particularly popular.

The earliest known mention of a Cobbler cocktail dates back to 1838, found in the diary of Katherine Jane Ellice, a Canadian traveler in the United States. The drink's popularity surged, and it was notably featured in Jerry Thomas's 1862 "The Bar-Tender's Guide," one of the first books specifically for bartenders. Its international recognition further grew when Charles Dickens included it in his novel "The Life and Adventures of Martin Chuzzlewit." The Sherry Cobbler, a variation made with sherry, sugar, and citrus, was a revolutionary drink for its time, introducing crushed ice and drinking straws, which were novelties that set fashionable drinkers apart. The Cobbler is also credited with popularizing the use of drinking straws and is even theorized to have influenced the development of the three-piece cocktail shaker. Its popularity continued through the end of the 1800s, with Harry Johnson noting its widespread appeal among both men and women in his 1888 "New and Improved Bartender's Manual." However, its prominence waned after Prohibition.

The name "Cobbler" most likely derives from the "cobbles," or small pebbles of ice, used in the drink. This refers to the crushed or pebbled ice that filled the glass, resembling cobblestones. A Cobbler cocktail is generally characterized by its simple template: a spirit or wine, a sweetener, a generous amount of crushed ice, and a fruity garnish. While traditionally wine-based, particularly with sherry, variations using other spirits also exist.
