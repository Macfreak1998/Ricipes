# History
The "Daiquiri" cocktail boasts a fascinating history and origin, rooted in the natural ingredients of the Caribbeaccordingly. It is widely believed to have been invented around 1898 by Jennings Cox, an American mining engineer working near Santiago de Cuba, Cuba. The cocktail takes its name from Daiquirí, a beach and iron mine in the region, a word of Taíno origin.

The classic Daiquiri is characterized by its simple composition, consisting of just three main ingredients: rum, citrus juice (typically fresh lime juice), and sugar or another sweetener. These core components are derived from natural sources: rum from sugarcane, fresh lime juice, and natural sugar.

The story of its creation suggests that Cox improvised the drink for guests using the readily available rum, limes, and sugar, adding crushed ice for a refreshing effect. This combination was not entirely new, bearing similarities to the grog consumed by British sailors, which by the late 18th century included rum, water, lime juice, and sugar.

The Daiquiri's popularity surged in the United States, especially during Prohibition, as Americans visited Cuba. Its fame was further cemented by bartenders like Constantino Ribalaigua Vert at Havana's El Floridita, who refined the recipe and introduced variations such as the Frozen Daiquiri. Notable figures like Ernest Hemingway and President John F. Kennedy were known admirers of the drink. The enduring appeal of the Daiquiri lies in its straightforward preparation and the natural freshness of its ingredients.
