# History
The Sir Walter cocktail, also known as the "Swalter," has its origins in the pre-Prohibition era and was first documented in Harry MacElhone's influential 1927 book, "Barflies and Cocktails." MacElhone, a Scottish bartender, owned the renowned Harry's New York Bar in Paris, which became a famous expatriate establishment.

The cocktail is a blend of rum and cognac, with sweet hints of orange and pomegranate. While there's some conjecture about whether it was named after Sir Walter Raleigh or Sir Walter Scott, many believe it honors Sir Walter Scott due to MacElhone's Scottish heritage. The recipe for the Sir Walter cocktail was also included in "The Savoy Cocktail Book" in 1930.

This recipe, with white rum, brandy (cognac), lemon juice, triple sec, and grenadine, aligns with the classic structure of this historically significant cocktail, offering a balanced and flavorful drink.
