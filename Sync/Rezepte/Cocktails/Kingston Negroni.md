# History
The "Kingston Negroni" is a contemporary variation of the classic Negroni cocktail, distinguished by its use of Jamaican rum instead of gin.

The classic Negroni is an iconic Italian aperitif, traditionally made with equal parts gin, sweet red vermouth, and Campari, served over ice, and garnished with an orange slice or peel. Its bittersweet taste is intended to stimulate the appetite before a meal. The most widely accepted origin story places the Negroni's creation in Florence, Italy, in 1919. Count Camillo Negroni reportedly asked bartender Fosco Scarselli at Caffè Casoni to strengthen his favorite Americano cocktail by replacing the soda water with gin. To signify this new drink, Scarselli garnished it with an orange slice instead of the Americano's traditional lemon.

The Kingston Negroni was created in 2013 by Joaquín Simó, a bartender at Death & Co, a renowned cocktail bar in New York City. Simó developed the drink after being inspired by a bottle of Smith & Cross, an overproof Jamaican rum.

The name "Kingston" likely refers to Kingston, Jamaica, highlighting the cocktail's key ingredient: Jamaican rum. It represents a modern interpretation of the Negroni, offering a different flavor profile while maintaining the original's structure of a bitter, sweet, and spirituous drink. This particular recipe features Overproof Jamaican Rum, Sweet Vermouth, and Campari, creating a bold and complex rum-based Negroni.
