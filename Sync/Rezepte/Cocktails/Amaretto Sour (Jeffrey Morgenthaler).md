# History
The "Amaretto Sour (Jeffrey Morgenthaler)" is a modern classic cocktail that represents a significant redemption of the original Amaretto Sour. Its history is deeply intertwined with bartender Jeffrey Morgenthaler's efforts to elevate a once-maligned drink.

The original Amaretto Sour was introduced to the public in 1974 by the importer of Amaretto di Saronno. It was initially a simple concoction of two parts amaretto liqueur and one part lemon juice. The cocktail gained popularity in the 1980s, but its widespread use of commercial sour mix led to a reputation as an overly sweet and one-dimensional drink, often dismissed by serious cocktail enthusiasts.

Around 2010-2012, Jeffrey Morgenthaler, a prominent bartender in Portland, Oregon, set out to "redeem" and "transform" the Amaretto Sour. He aimed to turn it into a "respected cocktail" by addressing its perceived weaknesses. His key modifications included:
*   **Replacing sour mix with fresh ingredients:** He opted for fresh lemon juice and a rich simple syrup instead of artificial sour mixes.
*   **Adding cask-strength bourbon:** Morgenthaler introduced cask-strength bourbon to the recipe, providing a much-needed "backbone" to the drink and cutting its inherent sweetness.
*   **Incorporating egg white:** The addition of egg white gives the cocktail a creamy mouthfeel and an attractive frothy top.

The result is a cocktail that is "stronger, brighter, and most importantly, less sweet" than its predecessor. Morgenthaler's recipe has since become a "modern classic" and is widely adopted and adapted by craft cocktail bars around the globe, fundamentally changing the perception of the Amaretto Sour.
