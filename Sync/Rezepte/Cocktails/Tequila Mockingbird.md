# History
The Tequila Mockingbird cocktail is believed to have been created sometime in the 1960s. Its name is a playful homage to Harper Lee's renowned 1960 novel, "To Kill a Mockingbird." While the exact provenance of the cocktail remains somewhat elusive, its clever name, a clear pun on the famous book, strongly links its inception to the period following the novel's publication.

This cocktail typically combines tequila, crème de menthe, and lime juice, often topped with soda water. The green hue from the crème de menthe and lime juice can evoke a sense of freshness and vibrancy, while the tequila provides a distinct agave base. This recipe, with tequila blanco, crème de menthe green, lime juice, and soda water, is a classic example of this intriguing and refreshing cocktail.
