# History
The "Lavender Breeze" cocktail does not appear to have a single, definitive historical origin. Instead, it represents a modern category of refreshing drinks that incorporate lavender, often featuring lavender alongside citrus and different spirits. This suggests that it is more of a contemporary concept for a floral-infused drink than a cocktail with a singular, traceable history.

Various recipes under similar names have emerged, often combining spirits like vodka or gin with lavender simple syrup, lime or lemon juice, and soda water. This particular recipe, with vodka, lime juice, lavender syrup, mint leaves, and soda water, creates a light, refreshing, and aromatic cocktail. It embodies the modern trend of incorporating botanical and floral elements into drinks, offering a unique and soothing flavor profile. Its origins are likely modern and specific to the creator or establishment where it was developed, showcasing an innovative blend of flavors outside of the traditional cocktail canon.
