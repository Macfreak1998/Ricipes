# History
The Hosita is a modern craft cocktail featured by Instagram cocktail curator @driftersjoint with the description: "A bold, agave-forward twist on an Italian icon." This cocktail represents the contemporary trend of adapting the Negroni template with agave spirits, creating what might be called an "agave Negroni" or "Tequila Negroni."

**The Negroni Template:**

The classic Negroni (equal parts gin, Campari, sweet vermouth) was invented in Florence in 1919 when Count Camillo Negroni asked bartender Fosco Scarselli to strengthen his Americano by replacing soda water with gin. It became one of the 20th century's most influential cocktails.

**The Agave Adaptation:**

The Hosita makes several modifications to the classic Negroni formula:

1. **Tequila Blanco replaces Gin**: Brings earthy, vegetal agave character instead of botanical gin notes
2. **Split Vermouth** (both sweet and dry): Adds complexity and balance, reducing the sweetness of sweet-vermouth-only versions
3. **Angostura Bitters**: Not traditional in Negronis, adds spice complexity
4. **Different Proportions**: 2:0.5:0.5:0.5 (4:1:1:1) makes this more spirit-forward than the equal-parts Negroni

**The Name:**

"Hosita" could be a play on "Rosita" (a well-known tequila-Campari cocktail) or might reference something specific to the creator's background. The diminutive "-ita" suffix in Spanish suggests something small or endearing.

**Flavor Profile:**

This riff "trades the gin's botanicals for bright, earthy agave notes, softens the bitterness of Campari, and creates one of the smoothest, most underrated agave cocktails you can sip." The split vermouth approach creates more nuanced herbal complexity than sweet vermouth alone, while the higher tequila ratio ensures the agave character shines through.

**Why It Works:**

Tequila and Campari are natural partners—both have bold, assertive flavors that can stand up to each other. Tequila's earthiness complements Campari's orange-rhubarb bitterness, while the vermouths tie everything together with herbal complexity.

The Hosita demonstrates that the Negroni's essential structure (spirit + bitter + fortified wine) is flexible enough to showcase different base spirits while maintaining the original's sophisticated balance.
