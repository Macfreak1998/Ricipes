# History
The "Kentucky Maid" cocktail was created in 2005 by acclaimed New York bartender Sam Ross, known for other modern classics like the Paper Plane and the Penicillin.

The Kentucky Maid is a variation of Ross's earlier creation from 2004, the London Maid (also known as the Old Maid). Ross developed the Kentucky Maid while working as the head bartender at Milk & Honey in New York City. The key difference between the London Maid and the Kentucky Maid is the base spirit: the London Maid uses gin, while the Kentucky Maid substitutes bourbon. This substitution of bourbon, a spirit strongly associated with Kentucky, gives the cocktail its name.

The creation of the Kentucky Maid helped establish a versatile "Maid" family of cocktails. In this category, the base spirit can be changed, and the first part of the cocktail's name is adjusted to reflect the origin of that spirit. Examples include the Mexican Maid (tequila), Polish Maid (vodka), and Irish Maid (Irish whiskey, often with St-Germain).

The "Maid" in the cocktail's name refers to this family of drinks characterized by a combination of a base spirit with muddled fresh ingredients, typically cucumber, mint, lime juice, and simple syrup. The Kentucky Maid itself is described as a refreshing, julep-like drink with the added freshness of cucumber and lime, balancing sweetness with the warmth of bourbon. It's often considered a crisp, herbaceous twist on a classic mint julep, ideal for warm weather.
