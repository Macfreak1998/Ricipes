# History
The "Dry Daiquiri" is a variation of the classic Daiquiri cocktail, generally implying a less sweet flavor profile than the original. The classic Daiquiri itself boasts a fascinating history, widely believed to have been invented around 1898 by Jennings Cox, an American mining engineer working near Daiquirí, Cuba. He improvised the drink with locally available rum, lime, and sugar for guests. The Daiquiri gained popularity in the U.S. during Prohibition and was further refined by bartenders like Constantino Ribalaigua Vert at Havana's El Floridita.

The term "dry" in the context of cocktails typically refers to a reduced sugar content. This particular "Dry Daiquiri" recipe, featuring White Rum, Campari, Lime Juice, Simple Syrup, and Passion Fruit Syrup, aligns with a modern interpretation. A specific modern "Dry Daiquiri" cocktail recipe was created around 2005 by Kevin Armstrong in London, often including ingredients like light gold rum, Italian red bitter liqueur (such as Campari), and passion fruit syrup, which contribute to its drier and more complex taste. This recipe offers a sophisticated twist on the classic, balancing the traditional Daiquiri elements with the bitter notes of Campari and the tropical sweetness of passion fruit, resulting in a more complex and less sweet profile.
