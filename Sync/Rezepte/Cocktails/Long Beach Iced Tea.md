# History
The "Long Beach Iced Tea" is a variation of the "Long Island Iced Tea," distinguished by its use of cranberry juice instead of cola.

The origin of the "Long Island Iced Tea" is debated, with two primary theories:
*   **Prohibition Era (1920s) in Long Island, Tennessee:** One account attributes the drink to "Old Man Bishop" from a community called Long Island in Kingsport, Tennessee. During Prohibition, he allegedly created a strong alcoholic concoction that resembled iced tea to conceal its true nature. His son, Ransom Bishop, is said to have refined this recipe in the 1940s.
*   **1970s in Long Island, New York:** A more recent and widely cited origin credits Robert "Rosebud" Butt, a bartender at the Oak Beach Inn on Long Island, New York. He claims to have invented the drink in 1972 for a cocktail creation contest that required the use of triple sec.

Despite its name, the "Long Island Iced Tea" contains no actual tea. Its name comes from its amber color and taste, which are said to resemble traditional iced tea. The cocktail is known for its high alcohol content due to its blend of several spirits. The typical ingredients include vodka, tequila, light rum, triple sec, gin, lemon juice, simple syrup, and a splash of cola.

The "Long Beach Iced Tea" was created by T.G.I. Fridays in 1980 to commemorate the 40th anniversary of its parent company, Carlson. The main distinction of the "Long Beach Iced Tea" is the substitution of cranberry juice for the cola found in the traditional "Long Island Iced Tea" recipe. This change gives it a brighter, fruitier, and more refreshing taste. This particular recipe features Gin, White Rum, Vodka, Tequila Blanco, Cointreau, Lemon Juice, Simple Syrup, and Cranberry Juice, creating a potent and fruity variation.
