# History
The Apfelstrudel Cocktail is a modern creation inspired by the traditional Austrian pastry, the Apfelstrudel. While the dessert has a history stretching back to 1697, the cocktail is a much more recent invention.

The cocktail aims to capture the comforting flavors of the dessert in liquid form, often combining apple juice, rum, and cinnamon. One version of the "Apple Strudel Cocktail" is said to have been created by Simon Difford in 2006. It has become a popular drink, especially in places with German and Austrian influences, and is often enjoyed as a liquid dessert.
