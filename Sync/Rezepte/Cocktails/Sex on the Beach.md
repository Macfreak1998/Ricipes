# History

The Sex on the Beach cocktail is widely believed to have been created in 1987 by a bartender named Ted Pizio at Confetti's bar in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, during Spring Break. Pizio reportedly invented the drink as part of a competition or promotion to sell peach schnapps. He named it "Sex on the Beach" after what he perceived to be the two main attractions for college students visiting Florida during that time.



The original recipe typically includes vodka, peach liqueur (schnapps), orange juice, and cranberry juice. The cocktail quickly gained popularity in the 1980s and 1990s, becoming a pop culture icon due to its catchy name and sweet, refreshing flavor. Its success led to its recognition as an official cocktail by the International Bartenders Association (IBA).



While the Ted Pizio story is the most commonly cited origin, some alternative theories suggest the drink might have appeared in cocktail books earlier than 1987. However, the cocktail's appearance in the 1988 movie "Cocktail" also contributed to its widespread fame. This recipe, with vodka, peach liqueur, orange juice, and cranberry juice, aligns with the classic and popular version of this iconic cocktail.
