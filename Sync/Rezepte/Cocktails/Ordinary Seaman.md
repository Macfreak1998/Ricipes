# History
The "Ordinary Seaman" cocktail is a modern creation that draws its name from the naval rank of "Ordinary Seaman," which refers to a seaman with some experience but who is not yet as skilled as an able-bodied seamaccordingly. While the term "Ordinary Seaman" has a clear historical meaning within maritime contexts, the specific origin and meaning behind the naming of this cocktail itself are not widely documented. It is likely designed to evoke a maritime theme, perhaps suggesting a straightforward yet robust drink.

This particular recipe features Lemon Juice, Lime Juice, Simple Syrup, Dark Rum, and White Rum. This combination creates a refreshing and potent rum-based sour. The blend of dark and white rums provides a complex rum flavor, balanced by the tartness of lemon and lime juices and the sweetness of simple syrup. It is a straightforward and flavorful drink, perhaps reflecting the no-nonsense nature often associated with sailors.
