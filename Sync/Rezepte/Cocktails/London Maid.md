# History
The "London Maid" cocktail is part of a family of drinks known as "Maid" cocktails, which were originated by acclaimed New York bartender Sam Ross. While the Kentucky Maid, created in 2005, is often cited as the first in this family, some sources indicate that the London Maid (also referred to as the Old Maid) predates it, having been created by Ross in 2004. The London Maid is essentially a variation of the Kentucky Maid, where gin is used as the base spirit instead of bourbon.

The "Maid" cocktails are characterized by their refreshing combination of a base spirit with fresh ingredients, typically including muddled cucumber and mint, along with lime juice and simple syrup. The exact meaning of "Maid" in the cocktail's name is not explicitly defined, though it's a naming convention for this class of drinks. The London Maid, with its gin base, highlights the botanical notes of gin, complemented by the freshness of mint and cucumber, and the tartness of lime. It is a crisp and herbaceous drink, ideal for warm weather.
