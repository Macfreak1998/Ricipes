# History
The Royal Bermuda Yacht Club cocktail, though bearing the name of the prestigious club established in Bermuda in 1844, does not have a definitively confirmed origin at the club itself. It is believed that cocktail books may have adopted the club's name due to its sailing theme, tropical association, and royal prestige.

The cocktail first appeared in print in Crosby Gaige's 1941 "Cocktail Guide and Ladies' Companion." While often attributed to Trader Vic, who featured it in his 1947 "Bartender's Guide," Gaige's earlier publication established the foundational recipe. Trader Vic's version further enhanced the tropical flavors by specifically calling for spiced falernum and orange curaçao.

Considered a "proto-tiki" drink, the Royal Bermuda Yacht Club cocktail typically features Barbados rum, fresh lime juice, orange liqueur (such as Cointreau or curaçao), and falernum. This recipe, with Demerara rum, Velvet Falernum, Dry Curaçao, and lime juice, aligns with the classic structure of this enduring tropical cocktail.
