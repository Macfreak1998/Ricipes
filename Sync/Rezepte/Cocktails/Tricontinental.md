# History
The "Tricontinental cocktail" is a layered drink typically made with gold rum, brown crème de cacao, and grenadine syrup, served in a champagne flute over crushed ice. The ingredients are slowly poured in a pousse-café style, in the order of rum, liqueur, and syrup, to create distinct layers.

While recipes for the Tricontinental cocktail are available, a specific historical origin, inventor, or detailed backstory for this particular cocktail is not widely documented. It is likely a modern creation that plays on the visual appeal of layered drinks, which were popular in the late 19th and early 20th centuries with drinks like the Pousse-Café.

The name "Tricontinental" itself might evoke a sense of global flavors or a blend of elements from three different "continents" or regions, though the ingredients in this recipe (gold rum, crème de cacao white, and grenadine) are fairly common in various cocktail traditions. This recipe offers a visually striking and sweet drink, perfect for special occasions.
