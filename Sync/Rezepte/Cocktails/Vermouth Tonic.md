# History
The Vermouth Tonic cocktail, while seemingly a modern trend, has roots deeply intertwined with the history of vermouth itself. Vermouth, a fortified wine infused with herbs and spices, originated in the 18th century in Turin, Italy, primarily as a medicinal tonic. The word "vermouth" is derived from the German word "wermut," meaning "wormwood," a key ingredient believed to have therapeutic properties.

As its popularity grew, vermouth transitioned from a medicinal remedy to a popular beverage, often enjoyed as an aperitif—a drink consumed before a meal to stimulate the appetite. Traditionally, vermouth was served on its own or mixed with soda water or tonic. By the late 19th century, vermouth became a staple in cocktails, with bartenders recognizing its versatility and complex flavor profile.

An early iteration of a simple vermouth-based drink, referred to as a "Vermouth cocktail," appeared in 1868. It consisted of chilled vermouth, a twist of lemon peel, and occasionally small amounts of bitters or maraschino, essentially a precursor to the modern Vermouth Tonic.

More recently, the Vermouth Tonic has gained prominence as part of the "Aperitivo" culture, particularly in Italy. It is seen as a refreshing and sociable drink, offering a fruity-bitter taste that pairs well with light appetizers. This resurgence positions the Vermouth Tonic as a counterpart to the popular Gin & Tonic, providing a lower-alcohol option that still delivers a complex and enjoyable flavor profile. This recipe, with vermouth and tonic water, is a classic example of this simple and refreshing aperitif.
