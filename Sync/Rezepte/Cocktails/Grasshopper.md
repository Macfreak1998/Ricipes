# History
The "Grasshopper" cocktail is a sweet, mint-flavored, after-dinner alcoholic drink, easily recognized by its vibrant green color. This distinctive hue is the reason behind its name, as it resembles the insect. The drink is typically made with equal parts green crème de menthe, white crème de cacao, and cream, shaken with ice and served in a chilled cocktail glass. Its flavor is often compared to mint chocolate chip ice cream.

The origin of the Grasshopper cocktail is largely attributed to Philip Guichet, the owner of Tujague's Restaurant in New Orleans. Legend states that Guichet created the drink for a cocktail competition in New York City in 1918 (though some sources suggest 1919 or around 1928), where it secured second place. Tujague's Restaurant continues to serve the Grasshopper as a signature cocktail today.

However, the full history is a bit more nuanced. A two-ingredient drink also called "Grasshopper," consisting of layered crème de menthe and crème de cacao, appeared in William "Cocktail Bill" Boothby's 1908 book, attributed to Harry O'Brien. It is not definitively known when cream was added to create the shaken, three-ingredient version popular today, but it could have been Guichet's innovation. The modern Grasshopper gained significant popularity in the 1950s and 1960s, particularly across the American South, and saw another resurgence during the disco era of the 1970s and 80s.
