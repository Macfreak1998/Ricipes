# History
The Vieux Carré cocktail was invented in 1938 by Walter Bergeron, the head bartender at the Hotel Monteleone in New Orleans. Bergeron created the drink in the hotel's Swan Room, which is now known as the Carousel Bar.

The name "Vieux Carré" is French for "old square" and refers to the historic French Quarter of New Orleans. Bergeron intended the cocktail as a tribute to the diverse cultural influences present in the French Quarter. The ingredients reflect this: sweet vermouth for the Italians, cognac and Bénédictine for the French, rye whiskey for the Americans, and bitters for the Caribbean community.

The recipe for the Vieux Carré first appeared in Stanley Clisby Arthur's 1937 (or 1938, according to some sources) cocktail book, "Famous New Orleans Drinks and How to Mix 'Em." The cocktail typically consists of rye whiskey, cognac, sweet vermouth, Bénédictine D.O.M., Peychaud's bitters, and Angostura bitters. This recipe, with rye whiskey, cognac, sweet vermouth, Bénédictine, and Angostura bitters, is a classic example of this iconic New Orleans cocktail.
