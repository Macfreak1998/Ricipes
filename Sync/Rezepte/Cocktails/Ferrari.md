# History
The "Ferrari" cocktail is a name applied to various drinks, with the most common interpretation being a shot of equal parts Campari and Fernet Branca, often referred to as a "bartender's handshake" due to its popularity among industry professionals. This version is a playful nod to the Italian origins of its two main ingredients.

This particular recipe, featuring Dry Vermouth and Amaretto, is a unique interpretation of a "Ferrari" cocktail. It deviates significantly from the more common Campari and Fernet Branca combination. This version offers a lighter, aromatic, and slightly sweet profile, highlighting the herbal notes of dry vermouth and the almond sweetness of amaretto. The name "Ferrari" in this context might evoke a sense of Italian elegance, speed, or a sophisticated, streamlined drink, rather than the bold bitterness of the more common "Ferrari" shot.
