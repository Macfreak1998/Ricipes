# History
The "Honolulu Juicer cocktail" has a history rooted in the late 1930s, attributed to the renowned tiki bartender Trader Vic (Victor Bergeron), who claimed it as one of his earliest creations. The original recipe, as found in Trader Vic's Bartender's Manual from 1972, included 1/2 slice of pineapple, 1/2 ounce of lemon juice, a dash of rock candy syrup, a dash of grenadine, and 1 1/2 ounces of light Puerto Rican rum.

The cocktail gained significant popularity during the disco era of the 1970s and 1980s. During this period, a common variation emerged that incorporated Southern Comfort, a whiskey liqueur, into the drink, despite it not being part of Trader Vic's original formulation. The exact origin of this substitution remains unclear.

The "Honolulu Juicer" is considered a fun, tropical Tiki drink, particularly enjoyed during the summer months. It's often seen as a more relaxed alternative to some of the more complex and potent Tiki creations. This particular recipe features Lemon Juice, Rose's Lime Juice, Powdered Sugar, Pineapple Juice, Southern Comfort, and Dark Rum, creating a vibrant and fruity tropical drink with a hint of Southern Comfort's unique flavor.
