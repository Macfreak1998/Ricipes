# History
The Prescription Julep cocktail has a rich history, stemming from the broader evolution of juleps as a drink category. Juleps initially emerged around 900 A.D. and were primarily regarded as medicinal beverages for a significant portion of their early existence. The transition of juleps from medicinal concoctions to recreational drinks occurred in America during the late 1700s, with mint being introduced around 1802.

The specific "Prescription Julep," characterized by its blend of cognac and rye whiskey, made its first appearance in print in 1857. It was featured in a serial titled "A Winter in The South" published in Harper's Monthly or Harper's New Monthly Magazine. Unlike many Mint Juleps that are bourbon-based, the Prescription Julep utilizes cognac and rye whiskey, a combination praised by cocktail historians for how the cognac softens the rye's edges while the rye adds spice to the cognac. The "Prescription" in its name is understood to be ironic, as it was not a genuine medical prescription, though juleps in general did have a history of being used as vehicles for medicine.
