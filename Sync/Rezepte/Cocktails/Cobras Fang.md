# History
The "Cobra's Fang" is a classic tiki cocktail with a rich history, originating in the late 1930s at Don the Beachcomber's legendary Hollywood bar. It was created by Donn Beach, a pioneer of the tiki movement.

The cocktail's name, like many others on Don the Beachcomber's menus, was chosen to evoke a sense of "faux-danger" and an "exotic tropical mood," contributing to the overall tiki aesthetic of his establishments. The name is intended to suggest something dangerous, akin to encountering a cobra.

The "Cobra's Fang" is characterized by its complex blend of ingredients, typical of Donn Beach's style. It features a combination of rums (often Jamaican and high-proof Guyanese/Demerara rums), falernum, fassionola syrup (a tropical fruit syrup), absinthe, bitters, lime juice, and orange juice. Donn Beach was known for his meticulous blending of rums, use of multiple sweeteners, and fresh citrus, often incorporating absinthe and Angostura bitters into his creations. The fassionola syrup was a particularly crucial and secretive ingredient, with its exact formula closely guarded by Beach.

Historically, the drink was served in a tall, curved glass, though some later menus depicted it in a snake-shaped tiki mug, sparking debate about the authenticity of such a mug in its early days. Common garnishes include fresh mint and a lime wheel, with some presentations featuring a spiral-cut lime peel to resemble a snake.
