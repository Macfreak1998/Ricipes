# History
The "French Daiquiri" is a modern twist on the classic Daiquiri cocktail, often incorporating French ingredients. While there isn't one single historical origin for a cocktail explicitly named "French Daiquiri," common variations include the addition of Crème de Cassis (blackcurrant liqueur).

The **Daiquiri** cocktail itself is widely attributed to American mining engineer Jennings Cox in 1898. Cox was working near the town of Daiquirí, Cuba, and legend has it that he invented the drink when he ran out of gin while entertaining guests and instead mixed rum with sugar and lime juice. The basic components of a Daiquiri are rum, citrus juice (typically lime), and sugar. The cocktail gained popularity in the United States after being introduced to the Army & Navy Club in Washington D.C. by Admiral Lucius Johnson around 1909. Notable enthusiasts included Ernest Hemingway and John F. Kennedy.

**Crème de Cassis** is a sweet, dark red liqueur made from blackcurrants. Its origins trace back to the 16th century in the Burgundy region of France, where blackcurrants were initially cultivated for their medicinal properties. The modern form of Crème de Cassis was first introduced in 1841 by Auguste Denis Lagoute in Dijon, France. It remains a specialty of Burgundy and is famously used in cocktails such as the Kir and Kir Royal.

This "French Daiquiri" combines the classic Cuban Daiquiri with the French Crème de Cassis, creating a fruity and slightly tart variation with a beautiful reddish hue.
