# History
The Passoa Spritz is a modern cocktail that was developed by the Passoa brand to capitalize on the global popularity of spritz-style drinks. While the concept of the "spritz" dates back to the 19th century, the Passoa Spritz is a contemporary creation.

Passoa, a passion fruit liqueur, was created in 1985 by Rémy Cointreau in France. It quickly gained recognition for its vibrant passion fruit flavor and its use in popular cocktails like the Porn Star Martini.

The Passoa Spritz combines Passoa with Prosecco and a splash of soda water, creating a sweet, fruity, and refreshing drink. It is often described as a "sweet and fruity upgrade of the regular spritz" and is known for its distinctive red hue, making it a popular choice for summer and festive occasions.
