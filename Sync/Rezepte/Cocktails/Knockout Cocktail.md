# History
The "Knockout Cocktail" refers to at least two distinct drink recipes, both deriving their name from the potent effect or strong nature implied by the term "knockout."

This particular recipe, featuring Gin, Dry Vermouth, Pernod, and White Crème de Menthe, aligns with one of the historical renditions of the Knockout Cocktail. Its name is directly linked to the term "knockout" from combat sports, where it refers to a strike that renders an opponent unconscious or unable to continue fighting.

While the exact origin and inventor of this specific Knockout Cocktail are not widely documented, its presence in historical cocktail literature suggests it emerged in an era when cocktails were often named for their perceived strength or impact. The combination of gin, vermouth, and the anise notes of Pernod, along with the minty freshness of crème de menthe, creates a complex and intriguing flavor profile. It is a spirit-forward drink that, true to its name, is designed to deliver a memorable and potent experience.
