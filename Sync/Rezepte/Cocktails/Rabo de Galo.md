# History
Rabo de Galo (Portuguese for "Rooster's Tail") is a classic Brazilian cocktail that emerged in São Paulo in the mid-1950s, shortly after the Italian vermouth producer Cinzano opened a factory in Brazil. The drink represents a uniquely Brazilian fusion of local cachaça with Italian vermouth culture.

The cocktail's origins are rooted in São Paulo's dive bars and working-class neighborhoods, where it was originally served as a simple shot combining cachaça and sweet vermouth. The proportions varied by region and establishment, but the classic ratio was typically 2/3 cachaça to 1/3 sweet vermouth - a potent combination that earned its colorful name.

In 2024, the Rabo de Galo received international recognition when it was added to the IBA (International Bartenders Association) official cocktail list as part of the Contemporary Classics category. The modern IBA recipe includes Cynar (an Italian artichoke liqueur) for additional complexity and depth, representing the drink's evolution from simple bar shot to sophisticated cocktail.

The cocktail's name and character reflect Brazilian bar culture's irreverent spirit - bold, unpretentious, and designed for conviviality. Different regions of Brazil have their own variations, with some preferring higher cachaça ratios while others add local ingredients.

The addition of Cynar in modern versions creates a more complex flavor profile with herbal and bitter notes that complement cachaça's grassy, funky character and vermouth's sweetness. The optional Angostura bitters add another layer of aromatic complexity.

The Rabo de Galo stands as Brazil's contribution to the global cocktail canon, showcasing cachaça in a role beyond the Caipirinha.
