# History
The "Old Fashioned" cocktail boasts a rich history, with its origins intertwined with the very definition of a "cocktail" itself. Its name reflects a desire for simplicity amidst evolving mixology.

**Origin and History:**
The fundamental components of what would become the Old Fashioned—spirit, sugar, water, and bitters—were first documented in print in 1806 in a New York newspaper, defining what a "cock-tail" was. This early description laid the groundwork for the classic drink.

The specific Old Fashioned cocktail recipe, as it is largely known today, is often credited to bartenders at the Pendennis Club in Louisville, Kentucky, in 1881. They are said to have crafted it in honor of Colonel James E. Pepper, a renowned whiskey distiller. Colonel Pepper subsequently introduced this recipe to the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York City, contributing to its widespread recognition. However, the exact invention remains a subject of debate, with some suggesting earlier mentions of "whiskey old-fashioned cocktails" in other publications. Some theories even trace the concept back to 17th-century London. Louisville, Kentucky, has since embraced the Old Fashioned as its official cocktail.

**Meaning:**
The name "Old Fashioned" emerged in the mid-19th century. As cocktails became increasingly elaborate with new ingredients, drinkers began requesting drinks made "the old-fashioned way," seeking a return to simpler, traditional preparations. This desire for a classic, uncomplicated drink led to the adoption of the name "Old Fashioned" for this particular style of cocktail.

**Composition:**
A classic Old Fashioned typically consists of whiskey (most commonly bourbon), a sugar cube or simple syrup, a few dashes of Angostura bitters, and sometimes a splash of water or soda water. It is traditionally served on the rocks in a lowball glass and garnished with an orange slice and a cocktail cherry.
