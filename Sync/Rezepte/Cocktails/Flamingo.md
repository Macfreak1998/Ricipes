# History
The "Flamingo" cocktail has a few attributed origins, and its name is primarily linked to its distinctive color and, in some cases, historical figures.

One prominent origin story credits the Flamingo cocktail to the Flamingo Hotel in Las Vegas. It appears in Ted Saucier's 1951 book *Bottoms Up*, where the recipe is attributed to the Flamingo Hotel. Another account suggests its origin is tied to the reopening of the Flamingo Hotel in Las Vegas after its renovation in 1954. The Flamingo Hotel and Casino itself was opened in 1946 by mobster Bugsy Siegel and his partners.

Separately, the Windsor Court Hotel in New Orleans features its own "Flamingo" cocktail, which is a modern variation of a Prohibition-era drink known as the "Pink Chamois." The hotel also states that their cocktail's name was inspired by Virginia Hill, who was Bugsy Siegel's girlfriend and nicknamed "Flamingo."

The cocktail is often characterized by its beautiful pink hue, which is a direct inspiration for its name. It is frequently described as a tasty and fruity drink, ideal for a warm afternoon by the pool. This particular recipe, featuring Lime Juice, Grenadine, Pineapple Juice, and White Rum, creates a vibrant, fruity, and refreshing drink that perfectly embodies the "Flamingo" name.
