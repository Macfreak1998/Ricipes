# History
The "Hemingway Special" cocktail, also known as the Hemingway Daiquiri, originated at the renowned "El Floridita" bar in Havana, Cuba.

Its history is closely tied to the famous American author Ernest Hemingway, who was a frequent patron of El Floridita in the 1930s. Hemingway, known for his dislike of overly sweet drinks, initially requested a modification to the traditional Floridita Daiquiri. He asked for a version with less sugar and double the rum, which became known as the "Hemingway Daiquiri" or "Papa Doble" (due to his nickname "Papa" and the double rum).

The recipe evolved further with the addition of grapefruit juice and maraschino liqueur, leading to the creation of what is now known as the "Hemingway Special." This cocktail is a tribute to Hemingway's adventurous spirit and his unique palate, reflecting his preference for a tart and refreshing drink. The Hemingway Special typically combines white rum, lime juice, grapefruit juice, and maraschino liqueur.
