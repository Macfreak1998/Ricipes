# History
The earliest known recipe for a "Shanghai Cocktail" was published in Harry Craddock's *The Savoy Cocktail Book* in 1930. While its precise origin is debated, it is believed to have been created between 1915 and 1928, likely in a location with access to Jamaican rum.

The cocktail's name evokes the cosmopolitan atmosphere of Shanghai, a city that saw significant Western influence and the establishment of Western-style bars from the mid-19th century onwards. This recipe, with dark rum, lime juice, simple syrup, grenadine, and Pernod (or anisette), aligns with the classic structure of this historically significant cocktail. The use of dark rum and the hint of anise from the Pernod give it a unique character, reflecting the exotic allure often associated with Shanghai during that era.
