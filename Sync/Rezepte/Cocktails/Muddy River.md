# History
The "Muddy River" cocktail, as presented in this recipe, is a modern and creative drink that does not have a widely documented historical origin. It is likely named after or inspired by the Muddy River Distillery, founded in 2011 in North Carolina, which is named after the "muddy Catawba River."

This particular recipe features Coffee Liqueur (like Kahlúa) and Heavy Cream, and is categorized as a "Kahlua Cream." This simple, two-ingredient cocktail creates a rich, creamy, and sweet drink, perfect as a dessert cocktail or a nightcap. It is a straightforward and indulgent combination that highlights the flavors of coffee liqueur and cream, offering a comforting and smooth experience.
