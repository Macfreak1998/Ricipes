# History
The Planter's Punch is a classic rum cocktail with a rich and somewhat mysterious history, largely attributed to Jamaica in the late 1800s. While variations of rum punches existed in the Caribbean much earlier, the Planter's Punch as a single-serving cocktail began to take shape around this time.

The drink is famously associated with a rhyming formula that outlines its proportions: "One of sour, two of sweet, three of strong, and four of weak," referring to lime juice, sugar, rum, and water (or ice), respectively. The earliest known printed recipe appeared in a London magazine in 1878.

The Planter's Punch gained international fame, particularly through the efforts of the Myers's Rum Company. It experienced a resurgence in popularity after World War II, especially with the rise of Tiki culture, as pioneers like Donn Beach and Trader Vic featured it on their menus. Today, there isn't a single definitive recipe, but it remains a beloved tropical rum cocktail.
