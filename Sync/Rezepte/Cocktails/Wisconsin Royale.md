# History
The "Wisconsin Royale" is a sparkling variation of the classic "Wisconsin Old Fashioned" cocktail, distinguished by its use of champagne or prosecco. The term "Royale" in the cocktail world generally indicates the addition of champagne or another sparkling wine to a drink.

The Wisconsin Royale builds upon the unique traditions of the Wisconsin Old Fashioned. The preference for brandy over whiskey in Wisconsin's Old Fashioneds is a significant historical aspect, believed to have originated around the 1893 Chicago World's Fair, where Korbel brandy was introduced to many Wisconsinites. Another theory suggests that the widespread use of brandy in Wisconsin stemmed from the availability of good quality brandy compared to poor quality whiskey during and after Prohibition and World War II. The practice of muddling fruit, such as oranges and cherries, in the Old Fashioned is also a hallmark of the Wisconsin style.

The Wisconsin Old Fashioned is traditionally served with a choice of soda—7-Up for "sweet," Squirt for "sour," or a mix of both for "press." The "Wisconsin Royale" elevates this by replacing the soda with sparkling wine, offering a more celebratory and "gussied up" version of the beloved regional cocktail.
