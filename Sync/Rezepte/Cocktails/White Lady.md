# History

The history of the White Lady cocktail is a subject of some debate, with two prominent figures often credited with its creation: Harry MacElhone and Harry Craddock.



The earliest known version of the White Lady was created by Harry MacElhone in 1919 while he was working at Ciro's Club in London. This initial concoction was quite different from the modern version, consisting of equal parts brandy, crème de menthe, and Cointreau. MacElhone later revised the recipe in 1929 at his own establishment, Harry's New York Bar in Paris, replacing the crème de menthe with gin, which is closer to the White Lady we know today.



However, the recipe that is widely recognized today is often attributed to Harry Craddock, a legendary bartender at The American Bar at The Savoy Hotel in London. Craddock included the White Lady in his influential 1930 publication, *The Savoy Cocktail Book*, which solidified its place in cocktail history. The Savoy Hotel maintains that Craddock created the gin-based version at their American Bar.



The addition of egg white to the White Lady recipe also has its own history, appearing in specialist cocktail books later. The White Lady is a variation of the classic Sidecar and is typically made with gin, Cointreau (or triple sec), and lemon juice, often with the addition of egg white. This recipe, with gin, Cointreau, lemon juice, and egg white, is a classic example of this elegant and refreshing cocktail.
