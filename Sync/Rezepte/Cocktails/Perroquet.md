# History
The "Perroquet cocktail" is a traditional French mixed drink, particularly popular throughout France and a classic in Marseille.

**Origin and History:**
The Perroquet cocktail is closely linked to the history of pastis, its main alcoholic component. Pastis itself emerged as a replacement for absinthe, which was banned in 1915. After the ban, a new blend of green anise, star anise, and licorice, known as pastis, was authorized in 1932. The Perroquet has seen a resurgence in popularity, appearing on terraces in Paris and remaining a classic in Marseille, where pastis originated around 1930.

**Meaning of the Name:**
The name "Perroquet" means "parrot" in French. This name is attributed to the drink's striking green color, which resembles the brightly colored plumage of a parrot, specifically the green macaw. Another possible explanation for the name connects it to absinthe; in the early 20th century, the popular expression "étouffer un perroquet" (to stifle a parrot) was used to refer to drinking a glass of absinthe.

**Composition:**
The Perroquet cocktail is typically made with Pastis, mint syrup (often green mint syrup), and chilled water. It is traditionally served with the pastis and mint syrup mixed in a glass, and iced water provided separately in a small jug so the customer can dilute the drink to their preferred taste. This particular recipe features Pernod (a type of pastis) and Simple Syrup, diluted with cold water, creating a refreshing and anise-flavored drink.
