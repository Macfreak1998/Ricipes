# History
The Part-Time Lover is a modern craft cocktail created by Jon Weimorts (@jondrinks) for Idle Hour, a notable cocktail bar in Los Angeles. The drink was featured by Instagram cocktail curator @anatomyofadrink, who praised the combination: "This cocktail was created by Jon Weimorts for Idle Hour (Los Angeles). Tequila and Aperol are a lovely pair and work wonderfully in this bittersweet sour. I love how the elderflower adds a floral component without it overpowering the drink, and bitters make everything better!"

**The Name:**

"Part-Time Lover" likely references Stevie Wonder's 1985 hit song, suggesting this is a drink for casual encounters rather than committed relationships—light, playful, and not too serious. The name also hints at the drink's versatility: suitable for various occasions rather than a single specific moment.

**Flavor Architecture:**

This cocktail represents sophisticated balance across several flavor dimensions:

- **Tequila Blanco**: Provides earthy agave base with vegetal notes
- **Aperol**: Adds bittersweet orange character and Italian aperitivo quality
- **Elderflower Liqueur**: Contributes floral sweetness (likely St-Germain) without overwhelming
- **Lemon Juice**: Bright acidity ties everything together
- **Angostura Bitters**: Adds spice and complexity
- **Grapefruit Peel Oil**: Aromatic citrus top note

**The Tequila-Aperol Pairing:**

While Aperol is most commonly paired with Prosecco (Aperol Spritz) or gin (various Negroni variations), its combination with tequila has gained traction in the craft cocktail world. The earthy, vegetal qualities of tequila complement Aperol's orange-rhubarb bitterness in unexpected ways, creating a more complex bittersweet profile than gin or vodka achieve.

**Los Angeles Cocktail Culture:**

As an Idle Hour creation, this drink represents Los Angeles' distinctive cocktail scene—less formally traditional than New York, more experimental than classic cocktail cities, but deeply serious about balance and technique. LA bartenders often create drinks that are simultaneously approachable and sophisticated, perfect for the city's indoor-outdoor drinking culture.

The Part-Time Lover exemplifies modern American cocktail craft: taking a spirit (tequila) beyond its traditional applications (margaritas, palomas) and proving it can work beautifully in more complex, aperitif-style drinks.
