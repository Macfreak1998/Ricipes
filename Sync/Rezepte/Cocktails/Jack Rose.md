# History
The "Jack Rose" cocktail is a classic American drink with a rich, albeit somewhat debated, history, primarily known for its vibrant color and its use of applejack. It gained significant popularity in the early 20th century, particularly during the 1920s and 1930s, and was a favorite of literary figures like Ernest Hemingway and John Steinbeck. It was even recognized as one of the "six basic drinks" in David A. Embury's influential 1948 book, "The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks."

The exact origin of the Jack Rose cocktail is not definitively known, with several theories circulating. Its first known appearance in print dates back to 1889, attributed to bartender Frank Hass at Fred Eberlin's bar in New York City. Other claims suggest its creation by a New Jersey bartender named Frank J. May (also known as Jack Rose), or Joseph P. Rose, a restaurateur from Newark, New Jersey.

The most widely accepted explanation for the name "Jack Rose" is a combination of its primary ingredient, **applejack**, and the **rose-colored hue** imparted by the grenadine. However, other theories about the name's origin include being named after the notorious gambler and gangster "Bald Jack Rose" (though the drink predates his criminal career) or a connection to the pink "Jacquemot" or "Jacqueminot" rose.

Beyond its popularity, the Jack Rose cocktail holds a significant place in cocktail history for almost single-handedly preserving the use of **applejack** in the cocktail world. Applejack, an American apple brandy, is one of the oldest spirits produced in the United States, with its roots tracing back to colonial New Jersey.
