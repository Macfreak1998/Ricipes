# History
"Julians Olive Brandy" appears to be a personal or specialty cocktail recipe, as there is no record of a widely known cocktail with this name. The name suggests that it was created by or for someone named Julian.

The recipe itself is a simple and savory mix of brandy, olive brine, and water, which is reminiscent of a Dirty Martini, but with brandy as the base spirit instead of gin or vodka. The use of Torres 10, a well-known Spanish brandy, gives the drink a rich and complex flavor that is balanced by the saltiness of the olive brine. While the history of this specific drink is unknown, it is a creative and personal take on a classic cocktail profile.
