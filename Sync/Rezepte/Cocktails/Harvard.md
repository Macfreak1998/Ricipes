# History
The "Harvard" cocktail is a classic drink with a history dating back to 1895, first documented in George J. Kappeler's "Modern American Drinks." It is named after the esteemed Harvard University.

The cocktail is essentially a variation of a Manhattan, but it uses brandy or cognac as its base spirit instead of whiskey. The original recipe typically included equal parts brandy and sweet vermouth, a dash of simple syrup, and bitters, all topped with club soda or seltzer. This addition of carbonated water distinguishes it from a traditional Manhattan, giving it a lighter and fizzier quality. The Harvard cocktail is often enjoyed as a sophisticated pre-dinner drink or aperitif.

This particular recipe, featuring Sweet Vermouth, Brandy, and Angostura Bitters, is a straightforward and elegant rendition of the Harvard cocktail, emphasizing its spirit-forward character and its connection to the classic Manhattan template.
