# History
The Salty Dog cocktail is a classic drink that originated as a variation of the Greyhound, a simpler concoction of gin (or vodka) and grapefruit juice. Its defining characteristic is the salted rim, which is said to balance the bitterness of the grapefruit and add a savory note.

The creation of the Salty Dog is generally attributed to the 1950s, an era marked by a flourishing cocktail culture and experimentation among bartenders. Actor George Jessel is frequently credited with inventing the Salty Dog in the 1950s, with the story suggesting he added a salted rim to the Greyhound to make the grapefruit more palatable.

Initially, gin was the preferred spirit for the Salty Dog, but over time, vodka has become an equally common and popular choice, offering a smoother taste. This recipe, with vodka and grapefruit juice, garnished with a salt rim, is a classic example of this refreshing and timeless cocktail.
