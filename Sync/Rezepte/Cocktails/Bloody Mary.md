# History
The "Bloody Mary" cocktail boasts a rich and somewhat contested history, with its origins generally traced back to the 1920s in Paris and its name's meaning debated among several theories.

The most widely accepted account credits Fernand "Pete" Petiot, a bartender at Harry's New York Bar in Paris, with inventing the Bloody Mary around 1921. During this period, American expats frequented the bar, and Russian émigrés brought vodka to the city. Petiot reportedly combined this Russian vodka with American canned tomato juice, adding spices, lemon juice, and seasoning to create the initial version of the cocktail. After Prohibition ended, Petiot brought his creation to the St. Regis Hotel in Manhattan, where he further refined the recipe by incorporating horseradish, Tabasco sauce, lemon juice, and celery salt.

The exact origin of the name "Bloody Mary" is a subject of much speculation:
*   **Queen Mary I (Tudor):** A popular theory links the name to Queen Mary I of England, often dubbed "Bloody Mary" due to her brutal persecution and execution of Protestants during her 16th-century reign. The cocktail's red hue is often seen as symbolic of the blood shed during this period.
*   **George Jessel:** Entertainer George Jessel claimed to have named the drink after a friend, Mary Geraghty, as stated in a 1934 advertisement.
*   **"Bucket of Blood" Bar:** Another theory suggests the name originated from a server named Mary at a Chicago saloon called "The Bucket of Blood."

The Bloody Mary holds a unique place in cocktail culture, primarily known for its consumption in the morning and its strong association with brunch. It has gained a reputation as a perceived hangover cure, a "lunchtime cocktail" that combines alcohol with the restorative qualities of tomato juice. Its versatility is also a key characteristic; bartenders often customize it with a wide array of garnishes and spices, transforming it into a drink that can serve as a cocktail, an appetizer, or even a meal.
