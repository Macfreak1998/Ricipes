# History
The "Florida Daiquiri," more accurately known as the "Floridita Daiquiri" or "Florida Style" Daiquiri, is a specific variation of the classic Daiquiri cocktail that originated at the El Floridita bar in Havana, Cuba. The bar was originally named "La Florida" and was affectionately called "El Floridita" by locals.

The original Daiquiri cocktail is widely believed to have been invented in 1898 by American mining engineer Jennings Cox in Daiquirí, Cuba, and traditionally consists of rum, lime juice, and sugar. The Floridita Daiquiri, however, evolved at the El Floridita bar, particularly under the influence of its head bartender, Constantino Ribalaigua Vert, often called "The Cocktail King of Cuba" or the "father of the modern daiquiri." He is credited with refining the cocktail and popularizing the frozen version by adding crushed ice, often using a granita machine.

Ernest Hemingway, a famous writer who lived in Cuba, was a frequent patron of El Floridita and significantly contributed to the drink's fame. He enjoyed a specific variation, sometimes called the "Hemingway Daiquiri" or "Papa Doble," which often included double the rum, no sugar (due to his diabetes), grapefruit juice, and maraschino liqueur.

The "Florida Style" or "Floridita Daiquiri" is characterized by being blended with crushed ice, giving it a slushy, frozen consistency. Key ingredients that distinguish it from a simple Daiquiri often include white rum, fresh lime juice, simple syrup or sugar, maraschino liqueur, and grapefruit juice (especially in the Hemingway variation). The addition of maraschino liqueur and grapefruit juice provides a more complex flavor profile than the traditional three-ingredient Daiquiri. The term "Florida Daiquiri" essentially refers to this iconic frozen, often fruit-enhanced, version perfected at El Floridita, a bar that attracted many American visitors, especially during Prohibition.
