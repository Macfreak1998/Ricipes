# History
The "Banana Cow" cocktail was created by Victor J. Bergeron, famously known as "Trader Vic," and is considered one of his earliest cocktail hits. The drink first appeared in his 1946 publication, "Trader Vic's Book of Food & Drink," and later in his "Bartender's Guide Revised" (1972) and "Rum Cookery & Drinkery" (1974).

The cocktail is a rich, milkshake-like concoction, often described as satisfying and low in alcohol. Trader Vic himself promoted it as "the world's finest, greatest, oh-so-good peachy hangover special," suggesting it as a remedy for hangovers, noting that "milk is good for you, and bananas are good for your stomach." The name "Banana Cow" likely stems from its primary ingredients: banana and milk, contributing to its creamy texture and flavor. A non-alcoholic version, omitting the rum, is also suggested as a suitable drink for children.
