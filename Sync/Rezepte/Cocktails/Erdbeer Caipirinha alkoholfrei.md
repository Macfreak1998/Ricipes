# History
The non-alcoholic Strawberry Caipirinha is a modern mocktail that captures the flavors of the classic Brazilian Caipirinha without the alcohol. The original Caipirinha, made with cachaça (a Brazilian spirit made from sugarcane), lime, and sugar, is the national cocktail of Brazil and has a history that dates back to the early 20th century.

The Strawberry Caipirinha is a popular variation of the classic, adding the sweet and fruity flavor of strawberries to the mix. The non-alcoholic version of this drink replaces the cachaça with a non-alcoholic substitute, such as ginger ale, sparkling water, or a non-alcoholic spirit. This allows everyone to enjoy the refreshing and tropical flavors of this delicious drink.
