# History
The "Between the Sheets" cocktail is a classic pre-Prohibition era drink with a debated origin, a rich history of recipe variations, and a suggestive name.

The exact origin of the "Between the Sheets" cocktail is not definitively known, with two primary theories emerging from the 1920s and 1930s. Many sources credit Harry MacElhone, a renowned bartender at Harry's New York Bar in Paris, with its creation in the 1930s. It is often considered a derivative or spin-off of the Sidecar cocktail, which MacElhone also helped popularize. Another theory suggests the cocktail was invented earlier, around 1921, by a Mr. Polly at the Berkeley Hotel in London.

Early versions of the cocktail in America during Prohibition may have been gin and rum-based. The drink first appeared in print in Frank Shay's 1929 "Drawn From The Wood," featuring gin, Bacardi rum, and Cointreau. As the cocktail gained popularity and traveled to Europe, brandy often replaced gin, making it more akin to the Sidecar. The modern recipe, typically featuring equal parts brandy, rum, and triple sec, was influenced by publications like Harry Craddock's 1930 "The Savoy Cocktail Book." There are also claims from American bartender Johnny Brooks, who stated in the 1950s that he created the drink in a Prohibition-era speakeasy in New Rochelle, New York.

The name "Between the Sheets" is widely considered risqué and suggestive, reflecting the Jazz Age era in which it gained popularity. While the precise origin of the name remains lost to history, it is often interpreted as a playful reference to the cocktail's potency, its combination of two spirits, and the potential for it to lead to "naughty behavior."
