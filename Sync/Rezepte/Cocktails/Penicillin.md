# History
The "Penicillin cocktail" is a modern classic cocktail created in 2005 by Australian bartender Sam Ross while he was working at the Milk & Honey Bar in New York City. Ross developed the drink as a variation of another Milk & Honey original, the "Gold Rush" cocktail, which features bourbon, lemon, and honey.

For the Penicillin, he substituted bourbon with blended Scotch whisky and incorporated a homemade honey-ginger syrup. A distinctive element of the drink is a float of peaty Islay Scotch, which adds a smoky aroma and flavor.

The name "Penicillin" is a playful, tongue-in-cheek reference to the cocktail's perceived "cure-all" or "healing" properties. The combination of ingredients like ginger, honey, and lemon is often associated with remedies for ailments, similar to a hot toddy. The name also subtly acknowledges Alexander Fleming, the Scottish scientist who discovered the antibiotic penicillin, fittingly given the cocktail's Scotch whisky base.
