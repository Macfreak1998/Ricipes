# History
The "French Colada" is a sophisticated variation of the classic "Piña Colada," blending traditional Caribbean flavors with French elegance. It is a modern adaptation that introduces distinct French spirits to its profile.

The name "Piña Colada" literally translates from Spanish as "strained pineapple," referring to the fresh pineapple juice used in its preparation. This iconic cocktail is typically made with rum, cream of coconut, and pineapple juice, often served blended or shaken with ice. Its origin is widely believed to be in Puerto Rico, though the exact creator is a subject of debate, with Ramón "Monchito" Marrero (1954 at Caribe Hilton) and Ramón Portas Mingot (1963 at Barrachina Restaurant) being the most prominent claimants. In 1978, the Piña Colada was officially declared Puerto Rico's national drink.

The "French Colada" takes this tropical foundation and elevates it with French ingredients. While it shares the tropical base of white rum, coconut cream, and pineapple juice, its distinguishing features are the addition of Cognac and Crème de Mûre (blackberry liqueur). These ingredients introduce a deeper, more complex flavor profile, with berry-like sweetness from the Crème de Mûre and refined oaky undertones from the Cognac. This particular recipe features White Rum, Cognac, Crème de Mûre, Coconut Cream, and Pineapple Juice, creating a luxurious and flavorful twist on the classic Piña Colada. There is no specific historical origin or inventor widely cited for the French Colada; it is understood as a creative evolution of the classic.
