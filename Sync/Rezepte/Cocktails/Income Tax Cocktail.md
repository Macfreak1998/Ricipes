# History
The "Income Tax Cocktail" is a classic drink with a history rooted in the 1920s, largely considered a variation of the popular Bronx cocktail. Its earliest known published recipe can be found in Harry Craddock's 1930 *Savoy Cocktail Book*.

The meaning behind its distinctive name is widely attributed to the "bitterness" associated with paying taxes. Some speculate that the addition of bitters to the Bronx cocktail, which forms the basis of the Income Tax Cocktail, directly references the unpleasantness of tax season. Another interpretation suggests that the drink's initial light and fruity appearance, followed by a drier and more bitter finish, mirrors the often frustrating and complex experience of dealing with income taxes.

The cocktail typically consists of gin, dry vermouth, sweet vermouth, orange juice, and Angostura bitters. This particular recipe features Orange Juice, Dry Vermouth, Sweet Vermouth, Gin, and Angostura Bitters, creating a balanced and complex drink with a hint of bitterness.
