# History
The "Improved Whiskey Cocktail" is a classic libation with a rich history dating back to the Gilded Age, roughly between the 1870s and 1900. Its origin lies in a period when bartenders began to "improve" or enhance existing cocktail recipes by incorporating imported liqueurs.

The term "improved" in its name signifies a refinement or enhancement of the basic "Whiskey Cocktail," which is what is known today as an Old Fashioned. During this era, the standard cocktail formula consisted of a spirit, sugar, and bitters. To "improve" these drinks, bartenders would add dashes of European ingredients such as maraschino liqueur, absinthe, and sometimes curaçao. According to Jerry Thomas's "Bar-Tender's Guide," a "fancy cocktail" typically included curaçao, while an "improved cocktail" specifically featured maraschino and absinthe.

The first written record of the Improved Whiskey Cocktail appeared in the 1887 edition of Jerry Thomas's influential bartending guide. This innovation not only diversified the limited cocktail options available at the time but also served as a way to showcase wealth and class. The emergence of these "improved" versions eventually led patrons to request an "Old-Fashioned Whiskey Cocktail" to distinguish the original, simpler drink from its more elaborate counterparts.

Today, the Improved Whiskey Cocktail is often described as a blend between an Old Fashioned and a Sazerac, offering the robust character of an Old Fashioned with the floral and herbaceous notes contributed by the maraschino and absinthe, reminiscent of a Sazerac. This particular recipe features Rye Whiskey, Maraschino Liqueur, Absinthe, Peychaud's Bitters, Angostura Bitters, and a Sugar Cube, creating a complex and aromatic spirit-forward drink.
