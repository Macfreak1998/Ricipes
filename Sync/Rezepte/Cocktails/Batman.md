# History
The "Batman" cocktail is a themed drink inspired by the iconic DC Comics character, the Dark Knight. While there isn't a single, definitive historical origin or inventor for a universally recognized "Batman" cocktail, various interpretations exist, often aiming to embody the character's dark, mysterious, and sophisticated persona through their appearance and flavor profile.

The recipe in this file, featuring Scotch, Lillet Blanc, Benedictine, and Orange Bitters, is a unique and sophisticated interpretation of a "Batman" cocktail. It deviates from some more common "Batman" cocktail recipes found online, which often include vodka, blackcurrant liqueur, lemon juice, and cranberry juice to achieve a dark color and fruity flavor. This particular Scotch-based rendition suggests a more complex, spirit-forward profile, perhaps reflecting a more mature or classic take on the character's essence. The use of Lillet Blanc and Benedictine adds herbal and aromatic notes, contributing to a mysterious and intriguing character, much like Batman himself.
