# History
The "Cruel Summer" cocktail is a modern creation, with several different recipes bearing this name, often inspired by the idea of a challenging or intensely hot summer, or in some cases, by the Taylor Swift song itself.

One version is described as a light, bubbly, and fruity rum-based drink designed to combat scorching summer days, particularly in hot climates like Texas. Its name reflects the "cruel" heat of August. This recipe typically includes white rum, strawberry syrup, lemon juice, and coconut sparkling water.

Other variations include:
*   **Christina Rando's Creation:** Featuring Old Tom Gin, gin, creme de banane, lemon juice, black pepper syrup, and egg white.
*   **Taylor Swift-Inspired Cocktail:** A direct reference to Taylor Swift's song "Cruel Summer," including gin, Italicus, damiana liqueur, orange liqueur, amaretto, simple syrup, and lime juice.
*   **Zach Zoschke's Award-Winning Drink:** Featuring Singani 63, grapefruit juice, lemon juice, simple syrup, and Campari. The name, in this context, was said to make sense during the 2020 lockdown when many were "drinking alone."

The common thread among many of these cocktails is their association with the summer season, often with a nod to its intensity or the desire for a refreshing escape.
