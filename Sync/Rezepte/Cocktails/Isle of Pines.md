# History
The "Isle of Pines cocktail," also known as "Isla de Pinos cocktail," is a classic Cuban drink named after the Cuban island of Isla de Pinos (Isle of Pines). The island was renowned for its high-quality grapefruit, which is a key ingredient in the cocktail. The name "Isla de Pinos" itself refers to the abundance of pine trees found on the island. The island was later renamed "Isla de la Juventud" (Island of Youth) in 1978.

The cocktail typically features white rum and grapefruit juice as its primary components. Some variations may also include sugar or sugar syrup and occasionally vermouth. This particular recipe features Grapefruit Juice and White Rum, creating a refreshing and simple tropical drink that highlights the flavors of the Cuban island.
