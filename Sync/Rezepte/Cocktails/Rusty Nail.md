# History
The Rusty Nail is a classic cocktail made from Scotch whisky and Drambuie, a Scotch-based liqueur flavored with honey and herbs. Its exact origins are somewhat unclear, but its first recorded appearance was at the British Industries Fair in New York in 1937, where it was initially known as the B.I.F. (British Industries Fair). This early version included a dash of bitters and was not immediately popular.

The cocktail gained widespread recognition and its enduring name in the 1950s and 1960s. It became particularly famous as a favorite drink of the Rat Pack, including Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, and Sammy Davis Jr., who were often seen drinking it at New York's 21 Club. The Drambuie Liqueur Company officially endorsed the "Rusty Nail" moniker in 1963.

Before settling on "Rusty Nail," the drink went by several other names, such as Mig 21, Knucklehead, Little Club No. 1, and D&S. There are several theories regarding the origin of the name "Rusty Nail," including it being stirred with a rusty nail, or the golden-brown color of the finished drink resembling aged, rusted metal. This recipe, with Scotch and Drambuie, is a classic example of this enduring and sophisticated cocktail.
