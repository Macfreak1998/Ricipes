# History
The Rory O'More cocktail is an Irish-whiskey-based variant of the Manhattan, closely related to the Rob Roy, which uses Scotch whisky. It is named after Rory O'More, a prominent organizer of the 1641 Irish Rebellion and an Irish nobleman known for his wit and compassion. The naming reflects an Irish counterpart to the Scottish folk hero Rob Roy.

The cocktail typically consists of Irish whiskey, sweet vermouth, and bitters. It appeared in A.S. Crockett's *The Old Waldorf Astoria Bar Book* (1935). It is also sometimes known by the name "The Emerald," appearing under this name in Jacques Straub's *Drinks* from 1914 and in *Mr. Boston's Bartending Guide*. The "Emerald" name is now more commonly used for this cocktail. This recipe, with Irish whiskey, sweet vermouth, and orange bitters, aligns with the classic proportions of this enduring Irish cocktail.
