# History
The Tommy's Margarita cocktail was created by Julio Bermejo in the early 1990s (some sources indicate 1987) at his family's establishment, Tommy's Mexican Restaurant in San Francisco.

Bermejo's innovation was to replace the triple sec or orange liqueur typically found in a traditional Margarita with agave nectar. This change was driven by his desire to enhance the natural agave flavor of the tequila and to create a more authentic and balanced cocktail, a philosophy he described as "respecting the agave." The core ingredients of a Tommy's Margarita are 100% agave tequila, fresh lime juice, and agave syrup.

The drink quickly gained international recognition for its fresher and more genuine taste, becoming a favorite among bartenders globally. Its significance was further cemented in 2008 when the International Bartenders Association (IBA) recognized it as a "new era drink," making it the first venue-specific cocktail to be included in their official manual. Although Bermejo developed the cocktail, its widespread name, "Tommy's Margarita," was popularized by London bartenders, notably Dre Masso and Henry Besant, who helped introduce the drink to a global audience. This recipe, with tequila, lime juice, agave syrup, and salt, is a classic example of this modern and influential cocktail.
