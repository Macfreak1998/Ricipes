# History
The "Airmail" cocktail is a classic drink with a history rooted in the early 20th century, closely tied to the burgeoning era of aviation and rapid communication. It is believed to have originated in Cuba or the United States during or shortly after the Prohibition era, specifically in the 1920s or 1930s. Its earliest known written appearance was in a 1930 promotional pamphlet by Bacardí, a Cuban rum company. This timing coincides with the establishment of regular airmail service in Cuba in 1930, including flights between Key West and Havana.

The cocktail gained further recognition when it was featured in W.C. Whitfield's 1941 book "Here's How" and later in Esquire magazine's "Handbook for Hosts" in 1949. While its popularity declined in the latter half of the 20th century, it has since seen a revival in craft cocktail bars.

The name "Airmail" is a direct reference to the then-revolutionary airmail postal service. In an era before widespread international telephone connections, airmail was the fastest way to communicate across borders. The cocktail often featured a postal stamp as a garnish, further emphasizing this theme. The drink's potent nature also played into its name, with W.C. Whitfield famously remarking that it "ought to make you fly high." The traditional Airmail cocktail is made with rum (historically gold Cuban rum), fresh lime or lemon juice, honey (or honey syrup), and sparkling wine, typically Champagne.
