# History
The "I like em fucked up" cocktail is a modern and unconventional drink that does not have a widely documented historical origin or a formal place in classic mixology. Its name is a colloquial and humorous expression, likely referring to its potent and eclectic mix of spirits, designed to deliver a strong and impactful experience.

This particular recipe features a blend of multiple spirits, including Vodka, Tequila, Gin, Light Rum, and Jagermeister, combined with Lemon Juice, Simple Syrup, and topped with Ginger Ale. This combination creates a complex and potent drink, balancing the diverse botanical, agave, and herbal notes of the spirits with the tartness of lemon, the sweetness of simple syrup, and the effervescence of ginger ale. It represents a creative and bold approach to cocktail creation, appealing to those who enjoy strong and unconventional flavor profiles.
