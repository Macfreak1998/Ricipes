# History
The "Latin Lover cocktail" does not appear to have a single, universally recognized historical origin or a definitive meaning tied to its creation, unlike some classic cocktails. Instead, "Latin Lover" is a term with broader cultural significance, primarily referring to a stereotypical character, and this name has been applied to several different cocktail recipes. The term "Latin Lover" itself originated in Hollywood in the 1920s, with Rudolph Valentino being the supreme representative of this character type, describing a handsome, romantic, and exotic male figure.

This particular recipe, featuring Lemon Juice, Rose's Lime Juice, Pineapple Juice, Cachaça, and Tequila Blanco, is a unique interpretation of a "Latin Lover" cocktail. It combines the vibrant spirits of Brazil (Cachaça) and Mexico (Tequila) with tropical fruit juices, creating a refreshing and exotic drink. The naming of this cocktail likely draws inspiration from the romantic and exotic connotations of the "Latin Lover" archetype, evoking a sense of passion and tropical allure.
