# History
The "Habana Libre" cocktail, as presented in this recipe, is a unique interpretation that draws inspiration from the spirit of Cuba, particularly Havana ("Habana" in Spanish). While there is no widely documented historical origin for a cocktail specifically named "Habana Libre" with this composition, it likely aims to evoke the vibrant cocktail culture of the island.

This cocktail's name is a clear nod to the famous "Cuba Libre" cocktail, which means "Free Cuba." The Cuba Libre originated in Havana, Cuba, around 1900, shortly after the Spanish-American War concluded and Cuba gained its independence. It is widely believed to have been created by a U.S. Army Signal Corps captain who mixed Cuban rum, Coca-Cola, and a squeeze of fresh lime, toasting "¡Por Cuba Libre!"

However, this "Habana Libre" recipe deviates significantly from the classic Cuba Libre by omitting cola and instead featuring Lime, Grenadine, White Rum, and Extra Aged White Rum, served with crushed ice. This composition suggests a more rum-forward and fruit-accented drink, perhaps a variation of a rum sour or a punch, emphasizing the rich rum heritage of Cuba. The inclusion of extra aged white rum and grenadine adds layers of complexity and sweetness, creating a distinct tropical profile.
