# History
The "Cosmopolitan" (often informally called "Cosmo") is a widely recognized modern classic cocktail. The name "Cosmogroni" is not a recognized cocktail name and is likely a misspelling or a very obscure personal variation.

The exact origin of the Cosmopolitan is widely disputed, with several individuals and locations claiming its creation.
*   **Early Mentions (1930s):** Some historical accounts trace a "Cosmopolitan Daisy" recipe back to a 1934 cocktail book, though this version was gin-based and quite different. A 1927 cocktail book also mentions a "Cosmopolitan" with entirely different ingredients.
*   **1970s - Provincetown/Minneapolis:** Some theories suggest the drink emerged in the gay community of Provincetown, Massachusetts, in the 1970s, or in Minneapolis. Bartender Neal Murray claims to have created it in 1975 at a steakhouse in Minneapolis.
*   **Mid-1980s - South Beach, Miami:** Cheryl Cook is frequently credited with creating an early version around 1985 or 1988 in Miami. Her recipe called for Absolut Citron, a splash of triple sec, a drop of Rose's lime, and just enough cranberry juice to make it "oh so pretty in pink."
*   **Late 1980s - New York City:** The internationally recognized version is often attributed to Toby Cecchini and Melissa Huffsmith-Roth in 1989 at The Odeon in Manhattaccordingly. Cecchini reportedly refined Cook's creation, using fresh lime juice instead of Rose's.

The Cosmopolitan soared to prominence in the 1990s, becoming a symbol of modern cocktail sophistication and urban culture. Its popularity was significantly boosted by the hit TV show *Sex and the City*, where it was a signature drink of the main characters. The drink's vibrant pink color, refreshing taste, and elegant presentation contributed to its iconic status.
