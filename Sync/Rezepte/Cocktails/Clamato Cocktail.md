# History
The "Clamato Cocktail" as presented here is essentially a variation of the "Caesar" cocktail, often referred to as Canada's national cocktail. It was invented in 1969 by Walter Chell, a restaurant manager at the Calgary Inn (now the Westin Hotel) in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.

Chell was tasked with creating a signature drink for the Calgary Inn's new Italian restaurant, Marco's. His inspiration came from his Italian heritage and a dish called *spaghetti alle vongole* (spaghetti with clams and tomato sauce). He reasoned that the combination of clams and tomato would make a good drink. Chell experimented for about three months, mashing clams to create a "clam nectar" which he then mixed with tomato juice and spices.

Chell originally named his creation "the Caesar." According to his granddaughter, his Italian ancestry led him to choose the name "Caesar." The longer name, "Bloody Caesar," is said to have come from a patron who, after tasting the drink, exclaimed, "Walter, that's a damn good bloody Caesar." This name also helped differentiate it from the similar Bloody Mary.

The Caesar is distinguished from a Bloody Mary by the inclusion of clam broth, typically in the form of Clamato juice (a blend of clam and tomato juice). The standard ingredients include vodka, Clamato, hot sauce, and Worcestershire sauce, served over ice in a celery salt-rimmed glass, and garnished with a celery stalk and lime wedge. It is a significant cultural icon in Canada, with Canadians consuming over 400 million Caesars annually.
