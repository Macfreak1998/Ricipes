# History
The "Periodista cocktail" is a drink with Cuban origins, and its name means "journalist" in Spanish.

Its history traces back to Havana, Cuba, with the earliest known recipe appearing in the 1948 "El Arte de Cantinera," a bartenders' manual from the Club de Cantineros de la Republica de Cuba. Legend suggests it was a favorite of Ernest Hemingway at El Floridita in Havana. Another historical anecdote links its popularity to reporters in Cuban bars during the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis.

The Periodista is often described as a variation of a Daiquiri, characterized by its bright and citrusy flavor profile, where tart lime and sweet apricot notes play a significant role. It typically includes rum, orange liqueur (like Curaçao or Cointreau), apricot liqueur (or apricot brandy), and lime juice. While traditionally made with light rum, some variations, particularly those popular in the Boston craft cocktail scene, use dark rum.

This particular recipe features Lime Juice, Simple Syrup, Apricot Liqueur, Triple Sec, and White Rum, creating a refreshing and fruity rum-based drink with a balanced sweet and tart profile.
