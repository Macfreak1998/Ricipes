# History
The "Cherry Fizz" cocktail is a refreshing, bubbly drink that belongs to the broader "fizz" family of cocktails. Fizz cocktails, generally characterized by an acidic juice and carbonated water, gained significant popularity in America between 1900 and the 1940s.

While there isn't a singular origin story for the "Cherry Fizz" itself, it emerged as one of many "fruity riffs" within the fizz cocktail family. Bartenders of the era experimented with various liqueurs, leading to the creation of drinks like the Cherry Fizz, which helped introduce liqueurs into mainstream cocktails.

The "meaning" of the Cherry Fizz lies in its balanced sweet and tart flavor profile, often described as refreshing and perfect for occasions like summertime gatherings or festive celebrations. This particular recipe features Lemon Juice, Cherry Brandy, Brandy, Soda Water, and Cherry Juice, creating a vibrant and effervescent drink.
