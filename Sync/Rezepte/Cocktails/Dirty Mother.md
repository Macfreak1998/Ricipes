# History
The "Dirty Mother" cocktail is an American drink that originated in the 1970s. It is essentially a variation of the Black Russian cocktail, where brandy is used instead of vodka, combined with coffee liqueur. Some recipes also suggest tequila as a substitute for vodka, making it a twist on a White Russiaccordingly.

The cocktail is also known by the name "Brandy Separator." Its rich and creamy flavor profile, often featuring coffee liqueur and brandy, makes it a popular choice for evening gatherings or as an after-dinner drink.

While the exact meaning behind the name "Dirty Mother" isn't explicitly detailed in historical accounts, it likely plays on the "Mother" cocktail theme and the "dirty" descriptor often used in drinks to imply a slight alteration or a less "clean" (e.g., cloudy from cream) appearance. A common variation is the "Dirty White Mother," which is made by adding cream to the "Dirty Mother," providing extra sweetness and a velvety texture.
