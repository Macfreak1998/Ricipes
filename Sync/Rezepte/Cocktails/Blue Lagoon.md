# History
The "Blue Lagoon" cocktail is believed to have been created by Andy MacElhone, the son of the famous bartender Harry MacElhone, at Harry's New York Bar in Paris during the late 1960s or early 1970s. The drink gained popularity in the 1970s, not long after blue curaçao, a key ingredient, was introduced in the 1960s.

The cocktail's name, "Blue Lagoon," derives from its striking blue color, which is reminiscent of the clear, tropical waters of lagoons found in paradise destinations around the world. This vibrant hue, combined with its refreshing taste, evokes a sense of holidays, freshness, and elegance. The drink's visual appeal and simple recipe, typically consisting of vodka, blue curaçao, and lemonade, have made it a popular choice for summer parties and a staple in bars.
