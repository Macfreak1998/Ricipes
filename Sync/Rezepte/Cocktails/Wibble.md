# History
The Wibble cocktail was created by the renowned British mixologist Dick Bradsell in 1999 at The Player bar in London, England. Bradsell invented the drink in response to a challenge from a representative of Plymouth Gin, who asked him to create a cocktail using their product.

Bradsell himself described the Wibble by saying, "it may make you wobble, but it won't make you fall down." The name is said to be inspired by the 1970s Weebles children's toys, which were advertised with the slogan "Weebles wobble, but they don't fall down."

The original recipe for the Wibble cocktail typically includes Plymouth Gin, Sloe Gin, grapefruit juice, fresh lemon juice, blackberry liqueur (Crème de Mûre), and sugar syrup. Dick Bradsell is also credited with creating other modern classic cocktails such as the Espresso Martini and the Bramble. This recipe, with gin, sloe gin, grapefruit juice, lemon juice, simple syrup, and crème de mûre, is a classic example of his innovative approach to cocktails.
