# History
The "Infante" cocktail is a modern classic created around 2009 by bartender Giuseppe González at Dutch Kills, a cocktail bar in Long Island City, New York City.

The drink is named in homage to Pedro Infante, a celebrated Mexican singer and actor from the golden age of Mexican cinema. The name also subtly references the Spanish word for "prince."

The Infante is often considered a variation of the Margarita or a member of the Daisy cocktail family, characterized by its tequila base. It's a sour cocktail that offers a nutty and floral profile. Key ingredients typically include tequila, fresh lime juice, orgeat (almond syrup), and often orange blossom water. Some recipes may incorporate rosewater or a dash of nutmeg for garnish. This particular recipe features Blanco Tequila, Lime Juice, and Almond Syrup, creating a refreshing and subtly nutty tequila sour.
