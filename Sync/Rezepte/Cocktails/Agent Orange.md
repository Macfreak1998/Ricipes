# History
The "Agent Orange" cocktail, as presented by the "How to Drink" YouTube channel, is a modern creation. Its name and characteristic orange hue are a direct, though controversial, reference to the chemical herbicide "Agent Orange."

Agent Orange was a defoliant used by the U.S. military during the Vietnam War (1962-1971) as part of "Operation Ranch Hand." Its purpose was to destroy dense foliage that provided cover for enemy forces and to eliminate food crops. The name "Agent Orange" itself came from the orange stripe on the 55-gallon drums in which the herbicide was stored. This chemical contained a dangerous contaminant called dioxin, which has been linked to severe long-term health problems affecting millions of Vietnamese people and U.S. veterans who were exposed.

While the cocktail's name might be a playful (though potentially insensitive) reference to its color, it carries a significant historical weight due to the devastating human and environmental impact of the chemical it references.
