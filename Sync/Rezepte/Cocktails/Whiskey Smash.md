# History
The Whiskey Smash cocktail originated in the 19th-century United States, though its precise beginnings are not definitively known. It is considered a close relative of the Mint Julep, distinguished by the inclusion of muddled fruit, typically lemon, alongside whiskey, sugar or simple syrup, and mint. The name "smash" refers to the muddling process of its ingredients.

The cocktail made its official debut in print in the 1887 edition of Jerry Thomas's "Bartenders Guide" (also known as "Bon Vivant's Companion"). While bourbon is a common choice for the drink, rye whiskey was also historically used and provides a spicier, drier finish.

The Whiskey Smash experienced a revival in popularity during the classic cocktail movement of the early 2000s. This resurgence was notably influenced by legendary bartender Dale DeGroff, who featured his version of the drink at the Rainbow Room in New York during the late 1980s and 1990s. This recipe, with rye whiskey, simple syrup, lemon wedges, a sugar cube, and fresh mint, is a classic example of this refreshing and flavorful cocktail.
