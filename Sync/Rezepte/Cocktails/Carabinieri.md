# History
The "Carabinieri" cocktail is a drink inspired by and named after Italy's national police force, the Carabinieri. The term "Carabinieri" itself translates to "riflemen" in English, stemming from the French word "carabinier," which referred to a soldier armed with a carbine. The cocktail is often seen to reflect the strength and sophistication associated with its namesake Italian institution.

Originating in Italy, the cocktail was created to honor the prestigious Carabinieri organization. While a specific date for its invention is not widely cited, it is recognized as a "classic cocktail" and a "bittersweet Italian classic." The Carabinieri force, established on July 13, 1814, as the police force of the Kingdom of Sardinia, played a significant role in Italian unification, which likely provided the historical context for the cocktail's creation.

There are several variations of the "Carabinieri" cocktail recipe. This particular recipe, featuring Tequila Blanco, Galliano, Lime Juice, Rose's Lime Juice, Egg Yolk, Powdered Sugar, and Orange Juice, is one such variation, offering a bold, refreshing, and creamy taste profile.
