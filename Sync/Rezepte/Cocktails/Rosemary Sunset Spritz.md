# History
The Rosemary Sunset Spritz is a modern variation built upon the foundational "Spritz" cocktail, incorporating specific flavor profiles like rosemary and grapefruit. The general history of the "Spritz" cocktail dates back to the late 19th century in Northern Italy, when Austrian soldiers diluted local wines with soda water. Over time, the Spritz evolved to include bitter liqueurs and Prosecco, leading to the modern spritz formula.

The "Rosemary Sunset Spritz" likely falls into these modern variations, utilizing ingredients like rosemary simple syrup and grapefruit juice to create a unique and refreshing flavor profile. While rosemary is mentioned as an ingredient in some modern spritz renditions, a specific historical origin for the "Rosemary Sunset Spritz" itself is not documented. It is a contemporary creation designed to offer a vibrant and aromatic experience, perfect for a sunset or a refreshing occasion.
