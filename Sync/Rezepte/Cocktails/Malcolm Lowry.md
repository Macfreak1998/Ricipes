# History
The "Malcolm Lowry cocktail" was created by drinks author David Broom. It is named after Malcolm Lowry's 1947 novel *Under the Volcano*, which delves into a man's struggle with alcoholism in Mexico. Malcolm Lowry, an English poet and novelist, is best known for *Under the Volcano*. His personal life was significantly impacted by alcoholism, a theme prominently featured in his work. He spent time in Mexico, where he continued to drink heavily and developed his seminal novel.

The cocktail itself is often described as a blend of a Daiquiri and a Margarita, characterized by its "funky" and "punchy" flavor. Its typical ingredients include Reposado or Añejo tequila, white overproof or light rum, triple sec, and lime juice. This particular recipe features Lemon Juice, Triple Sec, White Rum, and Tequila Blanco, creating a vibrant and complex drink that balances the elements of both a Daiquiri and a Margarita. The inclusion of both rum and tequila, along with citrus and triple sec, reflects the diverse and potent influences that might have inspired a drink named after such a literary figure.
