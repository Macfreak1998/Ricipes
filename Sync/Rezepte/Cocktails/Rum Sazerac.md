# History
The Rum Sazerac is a variation of the classic Sazerac cocktail, which has a rich and storied history rooted in New Orleans. The Sazerac is often considered one of America's oldest cocktails, with its origins tracing back to 1838. Creole apothecary Antoine Peychaud is often credited with inventing the Sazerac, initially serving a mix of his proprietary aromatic bitters with brandy.

Over time, the Sazerac evolved. Around the 1870s, American rye whiskey began to replace cognac as the base spirit, partly due to the phylloxera epidemic in Europe, which devastated French vineyards. In 1873, bartender Leon Lamothe is credited with adding a dash of absinthe to the cocktail. The Sazerac was officially designated as the cocktail of New Orleans on June 23, 2008.

While the traditional Sazerac is made with cognac or rye whiskey, the Rum Sazerac substitutes rum as the base spirit. This variation offers a different flavor profile, often with a more tropical or molasses-rich character, while retaining the classic Sazerac structure of bitters, sugar, and absinthe (or an anisette like Pernod). This recipe, with white rum, Angostura bitters, sugar, and Pernod, is a modern interpretation that brings a rum-forward twist to this historic cocktail.
