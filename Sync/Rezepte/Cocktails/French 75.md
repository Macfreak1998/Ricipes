# History
The "French 75" cocktail is a classic drink with a rich history, named after the powerful French 75-millimeter field gun used during World War I. The cocktail's potent kick was said to be comparable to the firepower of this artillery piece, which was renowned for its portability and rapid firing rate. The gun itself was a significant symbol of hope for France during the war against Germany.

The origin of the cocktail dates back to around 1914 or 1915, with an early version, then called "Soixante-Quinze" (Seventy-Five), possibly created by Henry Tépé of Henry's Bar in Paris. However, the recipe has evolved considerably over time. Early iterations, such as the "75" Cocktail found in Harry MacElhone's 1922 "Harry's ABC of Mixing Cocktails," included ingredients like grenadine, absinthe or anis, Calvados, and gin, notably lacking champagne or lemon juice.

The modern and widely recognized recipe, consisting of gin, champagne, lemon juice, and sugar, gained its "French 75" name and form in "Here's How" by Judge Jr. in 1927. This version was further popularized by its inclusion in "The Savoy Cocktail Book" in 1930. Precursors to the French 75 can be traced back to 19th-century "champagne cup" cocktails, which often combined champagne with lemon juice, sugar, and sometimes gin.

The glassware for the French 75 has also changed over the decades, moving from a coupe glass, to a Collins glass in the late 1920s, and finally settling on the champagne flute, which is common today.
