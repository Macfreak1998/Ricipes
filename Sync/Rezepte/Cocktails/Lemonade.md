# History
Lemonade, a refreshing drink made primarily from lemon juice, water, and a sweetener, boasts a history stretching back over a thousand years.

The earliest documented mentions of a lemonade-like beverage can be traced to 10th-century Cairo, where a drink called "qatarmizat," a mixture of lemon juice and sugar, was consumed. Further evidence appears in a 12th-century Arabic treatise by the physician Ibn Jumayʿ, who highlighted the health benefits of lemon-based drinks.

Initially, due to the expense of lemons and sugar, lemonade was a luxury enjoyed mainly by the wealthy and those seeking its medicinal properties. By the 17th century, lemonade gained widespread popularity in Paris, with vendors selling it from tanks carried on their backs. These vendors even formed a union, the "Compagnie de Limonadiers," in 1676.

The first published American recipe for lemonade appeared in "The Virginia House-wife" in 1824. The 1800s saw the emergence of carbonated lemonade, with the first reference to it in 1833. In the United States, the temperance movement of the 19th century championed lemonade as a non-alcoholic alternative, and traveling circuses further boosted its popularity.

The term "lemonade" generally refers to a sweetened, lemon-flavored drink. While historically and in many regions, lemonade refers to a non-carbonated drink, in places like the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Oceania, it commonly denotes a carbonated lemon-flavored soft drink. This particular recipe features Lemon Juice, Simple Syrup, and Soda Water, creating a classic and refreshing carbonated lemonade.
