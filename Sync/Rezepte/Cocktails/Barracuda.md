# History
The "Barracuda" cocktail is a vibrant, tropical drink with a rich history rooted in Italian bartending and cruise ship culture. It was created in the late 1950s by Italian bartender Benito Cuppari while he was working on the Cristoforo Colombo cruise liner. Cuppari perfected the recipe in 1965 after moving to the SS Michelangelo cruise liner. He renamed the cocktail after the Barracuda beach club in Portofino, a famous European nightclub managed by a friend.

In 1966, Cuppari and his Barracuda cocktail won the Long Drink category at the Italian AIBES National Cocktail Competition in Saint Vincent, which significantly boosted its notoriety. Initially served in a half pineapple shell, the drink's presentation was later upgraded to a souvenir ceramic pineapple mug as part of a marketing campaign by Galliano, whose liqueur is a key ingredient. This ceramic mug, imprinted with the Barracuda recipe, became a popular souvenir and the ship's signature cocktail. The cocktail's popularity soared in the 1970s, and it even found its way onto the menus of Trader Vic's bars in London and New York. The Barracuda cocktail is a staple in the International Bartenders Association's (IBA) official cocktail list.

The name "Barracuda" is a direct homage to the Barracuda beach club in Portofino, a trendy and famous nightclub in the 1950s and 60s. The cocktail's name also reflects its potent yet smooth flavor profile, similar to the sleek and formidable reputation of the barracuda fish. The Barracuda cocktail is a bright yellow, rum-based drink with an Italian flair, typically consisting of gold rum, Galliano liqueur, pineapple juice, fresh lime juice, and is topped with Prosecco.
