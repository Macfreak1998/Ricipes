# History
The Whiskey Cola cocktail, often referred to as a "Coca-Cola high-ball," first appeared in print in 1907. Its origins were documented during a study by the United States Bureau of Chemistry. Dr. Lyman Kebler, who was investigating Coca-Cola in the Southern United States, discovered a soda shop near a military base where soldiers frequently mixed whiskey with Coca-Cola.

This cocktail is considered a variation of the Rum and Coke, which itself evolved from the Cuba Libre, a rum, cola, and lime highball that originated in Cuba in the early 1900s. The Rum and Coke began appearing in the U.S. around the same time, in 1907.

The Whiskey Cola gained significant popularity during Prohibition, as mixing whiskey with Coca-Cola allowed people to disguise their alcoholic beverages. The "Jack and Coke," specifically using Jack Daniel's whiskey, became a particularly well-known and iconic version of the drink. Its popularity continued to grow, and following the death of Motörhead frontman Lemmy Kilmister in 2016, fans successfully campaigned to have the Jack and Coke officially renamed "The Lemmy" by Food and Beverage magazine, in honor of his frequent enjoyment of the drink. This recipe, with whiskey and cola, is a classic example of this simple and popular mixed drink.
