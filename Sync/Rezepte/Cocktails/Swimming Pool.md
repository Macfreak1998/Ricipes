# History
The "Swimming Pool" cocktail was created in 1979 by the renowned German bartender Charles Schumann. He is said to have invented it while working at Harry's New York Bar in Berlin, before opening his own Schumann's American Bar in Munich in 1982. The recipe was later published in his 1995 book, "American Bar."

This iconic German cocktail is a creamy, sweet drink that combines white rum, vodka, pineapple juice, coconut cream, and sometimes heavy cream. Its distinctive turquoise-blue color, reminiscent of a swimming pool, comes from the addition of blue curaçao, which is often floated on top. The "Swimming Pool" is often described as a variant of the Piña Colada, with the addition of vodka and blue curaçao. This recipe, with heavy cream, coconut cream, pineapple juice, vodka, white rum, and blue curaçao, is a classic example of this popular tropical cocktail.
