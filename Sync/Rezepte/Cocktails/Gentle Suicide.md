# History
The "Gentle Suicide" cocktail is a modern and creative drink that does not have a widely documented historical origin. The term "suicide" in drink names typically implies a potent or overwhelming mixture, often referring to a high-alcohol content or a blend of many different ingredients. The addition of "Gentle" to this name is unusual and suggests a unique, perhaps ironic, or localized creation.

This particular recipe features Vodka, Lime Juice, Lemon Juice, Waldmeistersirup (woodruff syrup), Simple Syrup, and Soda Water. This combination creates a refreshing, fruity, and slightly herbaceous drink. The "Gentle" aspect of the name might refer to its balanced and approachable flavor profile, despite the "Suicide" connotation, or perhaps to a more subtle, yet still impactful, effect. The inclusion of Waldmeistersirup adds a distinctive, slightly sweet and earthy aroma, making this a unique and intriguing cocktail.
