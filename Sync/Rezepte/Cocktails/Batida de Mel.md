# History
The "Batida de Mel" is a Brazilian cocktail, part of a broader category of alcoholic drinks known as "Batidas." The word "Batida" is Portuguese-Brazilian and translates to "shaken" or "beaten," referring to the cocktail's preparation method.

The origin of Batidas dates back to the late 19th or early 20th century in Brazil. These cocktails are typically made with cachaça (a white sugarcane spirit, which is Brazil's national alcoholic drink), fruit juice or pulp, and sugar, often blended or shaken with ice. They are commonly served chilled as an aperitif in Brazil.

Specifically, the "Batida de Mel" is a variation that includes lime juice and honey ("Mel" in Portuguese) alongside cachaça. While other Batida variations like Batida de Côco (coconut) and Batida de Maracujá (passion fruit) are more widely known, Batidas are traditionally prepared fresh in Brazil with a variety of fruits. The drink's meaning is rooted in its preparation method and its Brazilian heritage as a refreshing, fruit-based cocktail.
