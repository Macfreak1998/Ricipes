# History

The "Touchdown" cocktail, as a distinct historical entity, does not have a well-documented history like many classic cocktails. It appears to be a relatively modern creation without a deep, traceable historical root. The name "Touchdown" is often used for various drink recipes, likely referencing American football, but there is no concrete historical evidence to support a direct link to the sport's origin for this specific cocktail.



This particular recipe, with vodka, apricot liqueur, lemon juice, grenadine, and passion fruit juice, aligns with a common fruity and sweet long drink. It is described as a well-known long drink in many bars and is characterized by its refreshing taste. Its origins are likely modern and tied to the desire for appealing, themed drinks that offer a vibrant and flavorful experience.
