# History
The "Moscow Mule" is a classic cocktail composed of vodka, lime juice, and ginger beer, traditionally served in a distinctive copper mug.

### History and Origin
The Moscow Mule's origin is primarily attributed to the United States in the early 1940s, despite its name suggesting otherwise. The most widely accepted theory points to a collaboration in Los Angeles in 1941 involving three key individuals:
*   **John G. Martin:** An executive with the American distribution rights for Smirnoff vodka, who was looking for a way to popularize the then-unfamiliar spirit in the U.S.
*   **Jack Morgan:** Owner of the Cock 'n' Bull pub in Los Angeles, who was trying to boost sales of his homemade ginger beer.
*   **Sophie Berezinski:** A Russian immigrant who had inherited a large inventory of copper mugs from her father's company and was seeking buyers for them.
These three individuals, each with a surplus product, reportedly brainstormed a way to combine their offerings, leading to the creation of the Moscow Mule. Another theory suggests that Jack Morgan's head bartender, Wes Price, created the drink simply to clear out unsold inventory. The cocktail's popularity was further fueled by promotional efforts, including celebrity endorsements and the iconic copper mug.

### Meaning of the Name
The name "Moscow Mule" is a blend of references to its key ingredients and characteristics:
*   **"Moscow":** This part of the name is a nod to vodka's traditional Russian origins.
*   **"Mule":** The "Mule" in the name is often attributed to the spicy "kick" provided by the ginger beer. Another interpretation suggests it refers to the combination of three ingredients from different countries, much like a mule is a hybrid animal.

The copper mug is an integral part of the Moscow Mule experience, not only for its aesthetic appeal but also because it helps keep the drink exceptionally cold. The Moscow Mule played a significant role in making vodka fashionable in America and has since inspired numerous variations.
