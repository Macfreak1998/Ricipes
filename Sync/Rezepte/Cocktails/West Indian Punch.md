# History
The history of West Indian Punch is deeply intertwined with the broader history of punch, a beverage that originated in India in the early 17th century. The word "punch" is believed to derive from the Hindi word "panch," meaning "five," referring to its traditional five ingredients: spirit, citrus, sugar, water, and spice.

British East India Company sailors encountered punch in India, where they mixed local spirits like arrack with lime, sugar, water, and nutmeg. This concoction gained popularity as an alternative to beer and wine, which often spoiled in the tropical climate.

By the 1660s, English sailors had introduced punch to the Caribbean. In the West Indies, locally produced rum quickly replaced arrack as the primary spirit. Early West Indian punch recipes maintained the core elements of the original Indian versions, typically featuring rum, water, lime juice, sugar, and a grating of nutmeg. A well-known mnemonic for preparing punch was "One of sour, two of sweet, three of strong, four of weak."

This recipe, with lime juice, pineapple juice, orange juice, banana liqueur, and dark rum, is a classic example of a West Indian Punch, offering a vibrant and fruity tropical experience.
