# History
The "Kir Royal" cocktail boasts a rich history rooted in wartime resistance and French ingenuity. Its origin is attributed to Canon Félix Kir, a Catholic priest who served as the Mayor of Dijon, France, during World War II.

During the Nazi occupation, red wine, a staple of French culture, was confiscated. In an act of defiance and to uplift the spirits of his constituents, Canon Kir created a drink by mixing the local dry white wine, Aligoté, with Crème de Cassis, a blackcurrant liqueur. This concoction, known as the "Kir" cocktail, mimicked the color of red wine and became a symbol of resistance and Burgundian hospitality.

The "Kir Royal" emerged later, after World War II, when French bartenders elevated the drink by substituting the white wine with champagne, maintaining the Crème de Cassis. This made the cocktail more sophisticated and suitable for celebrations.

Beyond its simple recipe of Crème de Cassis and champagne, the Kir Royal carries a deeper meaning. It represents bravery, resilience, and an unyielding spirit, born from a time of adversity. Today, it remains a classic, elegant, and popular champagne cocktail, often enjoyed on special occasions.
