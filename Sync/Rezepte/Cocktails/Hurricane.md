# History
The "Hurricane" cocktail, a vibrant and sweet alcoholic drink, boasts a rich history deeply intertwined with New Orleans culture. Its origin, meaning, and evolution are well-documented.

The most widely accepted account credits Pat O'Brien's bar in New Orleans with the creation of the Hurricane cocktail in the 1940s. During World War II, there was a surplus of rum due to supply chain dynamics, while other spirits like whiskey were scarce. Liquor distributors often mandated that bars purchase large quantities of rum to secure more desirable spirits. To address this oversupply, Pat O'Brien, or possibly his head bartender Louis Culligan, developed a new cocktail to utilize the excess rum.

The cocktail derives its name from the distinctive hurricane lamp-shaped glass in which it was traditionally served. Beyond its glassware, the Hurricane has become a potent symbol of New Orleans' vibrant spirit, resilience, and hospitality. It embodies the city's ability to celebrate and find joy, even in the face of adversity, and is a staple during iconic festivals like Mardi Gras.

The initial Hurricane recipe typically featured rum (often Jamaican rum or a blend of light and dark rums), passion fruit syrup (or fassionola), and lime or lemon juice. While some modern variations include grenadine, pineapple juice, or other fruit juices, the core ingredients were rum, a passion fruit component, and citrus. This particular recipe features Smith & Cross Jamaican Rum, Gosling's Black Seal Rum, Passion Fruit Syrup, and Fresh Lemon Juice, creating a potent and flavorful tropical drink.
