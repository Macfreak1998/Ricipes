# History
The "White Cloud" cocktail does not appear to have a long or well-documented history within classic cocktail literature. Its origins are somewhat obscure, with one humorous theory suggesting it might have been concocted in a Wisconsin tiki bar by a manager looking to use up excess heavy cream.

Despite the lack of a definitive historical record, various interpretations and recipes for a "White Cloud" cocktail exist. Interestingly, a discussion on Reddit about the "White Cloud" cocktail mentions two versions, with one attributed to Mariano Licudine, a bartender for the influential Donn the Beachcomber. This suggests that at least one variation of a "White Cloud" cocktail might have roots in the tiki cocktail movement.

Common ingredients across different "White Cloud" recipes often include vodka, crème de cacao, pineapple juice, and cream, contributing to its "light and fluffy" character. This recipe, with heavy cream, pineapple juice, crème de cacao white, and vodka, is a classic example of this creamy, dessert-style cocktail.
