# History
The Pornstar Martini is a modern classic cocktail created by South African mixologist Douglas Ankrah. It officially debuted around 2002 at the Lab Bar in Soho, London, although some accounts suggest it was initially conceived in 1999 and called the "Maverick Martini" at his Townhouse bar.

Ankrah chose the provocative name "Pornstar Martini" to convey a sense of indulgence, style, and confidence, rather than to literally refer to adult film stars. His inspiration reportedly came from a visit to a strip club in Cape Town and a passion fruit cocktail he encountered in Brazil.

The cocktail's original recipe features vanilla vodka, passion fruit puree, passion fruit liqueur (such as Passoã), and is traditionally accompanied by a chilled shot glass of prosecco. It quickly gained immense popularity in London and became a global sensation, becoming one of the best-selling cocktails in the UK. Despite its controversial name, it remains a beloved and iconic modern cocktail.
