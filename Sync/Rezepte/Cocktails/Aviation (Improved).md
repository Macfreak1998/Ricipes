# History
The "Aviation" cocktail is a classic gin-based drink with a rich history rooted in the early 20th century. It was created by Hugo Ensslin, who was the head bartender at the Hotel Wallick in New York City. Its first published recipe appeared in Ensslin's own book, "Recipes for Mixed Drinks," in 1916.

The cocktail's name was inspired by the burgeoning field of aviation, which symbolized progress, excitement, and adventure in the early 1900s. The drink's distinctive pale lavender or sky-blue color, achieved through the use of crème de violette, was evocative of the open sky, further connecting it to its namesake.

The original Aviation cocktail typically includes gin, maraschino liqueur, lemon juice, and crème de violette. However, the cocktail's popularity waned for several decades, largely because crème de violette became difficult to find and eventually disappeared from the American market after World War II. The Aviation cocktail experienced a significant revival in the early 2000s, coinciding with a renewed interest in classic cocktails and the reintroduction of crème de violette to the market around 2007.

This particular recipe is an "improved" version of the classic Aviation cocktail, as described by the "How to Drink" YouTube channel, likely aiming to refine the balance or enhance certain flavors of the original.
