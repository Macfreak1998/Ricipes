# History
The Blue Kamikaze is a popular variation of the Kamikaze cocktail. The original Kamikaze, a simple and potent mix of vodka, triple sec, and lime juice, is believed to have originated on an American naval base in Japan after World War II. The name "Kamikaze" is Japanese for "divine wind."

The Blue Kamikaze is a modern twist on this classic, with blue curaçao replacing the triple sec. This substitution gives the drink its signature vibrant blue color while maintaining a similar flavor profile. Like the original, the Blue Kamikaze is often served as a shot but can also be enjoyed as a cocktail. It became particularly popular in the 1980s and 1990s.
