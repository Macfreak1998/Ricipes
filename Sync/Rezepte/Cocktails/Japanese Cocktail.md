# History
The "Japanese Cocktail" refers to a specific drink with a distinct origin, separate from the broader Japanese cocktail culture.

The Japanese Cocktail was likely invented around 1860 by the renowned American bartender Jerry Thomas. It was created in New York in honor of the first Japanese diplomatic mission to the United States, which toured the country and stayed at the Metropolitan Hotel, where Thomas was the head bartender. The recipe for this cocktail was included in Thomas's influential 1862 publication, "The Bar-Tender's Guide."

Despite its name, the drink itself contains no Japanese ingredients. Its name was a tribute to the excitement and public interest surrounding the Japanese delegation's visit to the U.S. The cocktail is described as a rich but simple combination of brandy, orgeat syrup, and aromatic bitters. While it was part of serious bartenders' repertoires until Prohibition, it was never widely popular and has not seen a successful revival since.

This particular recipe features Cognac, Almond Syrup (Orgeat), and Angostura Bitters, creating a rich, aromatic, and subtly sweet drink that pays homage to this historical event.
