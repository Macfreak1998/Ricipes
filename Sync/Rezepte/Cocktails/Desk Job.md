# History
The "Desk Job" cocktail is a spirit-forward drink created by Donny Clutterbuck of The Cure in Rochester, New York. Clutterbuck reportedly designed it as his ideal happy hour drink if he were to have a desk job, giving the cocktail its evocative name.

The cocktail gained recognition after being featured in the 2016 edition of *Food & Wine: Cocktails*. It is often described as a variation of a Manhattan, but with a rum base, offering a boozy, stirred experience. The combination of Punt e Mes (a bitter vermouth) and Cynar (an artichoke-based amaro) provides significant depth and a unique bitter element, complemented by the "funky" notes of Jamaican rum and the richness of a dark rum. The name "Desk Job" implies a sophisticated yet potent drink, perfect for unwinding after a long day at the office.
