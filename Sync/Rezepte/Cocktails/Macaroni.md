# History
The "Macaroni cocktail" appears to be a less common drink with a few different recipes rather than a widely recognized classic with a deep historical background.

This particular recipe, featuring Blanc Vermouth and Pernod, diluted with water, aligns with one of the documented versions of the "Macaroni cocktail." The name "Macaroni" in this context might be a playful nod to Italian culture, given the vermouth, or perhaps a reference to the historical "macaroni" fashion trend of the 18th century, which signified a certain extravagance or foreign influence.

The cocktail offers a light, aromatic, and subtly anise-flavored profile, making it a refreshing aperitif. The combination of blanc vermouth, with its delicate herbal and floral notes, and Pernod, an anise-flavored spirit, creates a unique and intriguing drink.
