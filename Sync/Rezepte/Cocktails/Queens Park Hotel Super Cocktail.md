# History
The Queen's Park Hotel Super Cocktail originated at the historic Queen's Park Hotel in Trinidad, an establishment that has since closed. The cocktail's story began in 1932 when British travel writer Owen Rutter visited the hotel. Intrigued by the drink, Rutter persuaded the hotel bartender to share the recipe, which he then published in a book a year later, in 1933.

While the exact creator remains a mystery, the cocktail is often described as a Trinidadian Daiquiri due to its significant use of Angostura Bitters, a product with a strong historical presence in Port-of-Spain, Trinidad. The Queen's Park Hotel was also known for giving rise to the more famous Queen's Park Swizzle.

The Super Cocktail, while having a quieter following, resurfaced in the spotlight in 2014 when tiki historian and author Jeff "Beachbum" Berry included its recipe in his book *Potions of the Caribbean*, bringing renewed attention to this forgotten classic. This recipe, with dark rum, sweet vermouth, grenadine, lime juice, and Angostura bitters, reflects the original proportions of this historic Trinidadian drink.
