# History
The "Hoop La" cocktail is a classic drink first documented in Harry Craddock's influential 1930 *The Savoy Cocktail Book*. Its exact origins are not extensively detailed, but its appearance in this book suggests it was either created by Craddock himself or was a known concoction he documented. It is noted for being an obscure cocktail that hasn't gained widespread popularity. Interestingly, the same book features two other cocktails, the "Frank Sullivan" and the "Odd McIntyre," that share the identical recipe, leading to speculation about Craddock's intentions or the cocktail naming conventions of the era. The "Hoop La" is often compared to the more famous Corpse Reviver No. 2, with the primary difference being the use of brandy instead of gin and the absence of an absinthe rinse. It has also been described as a "lightened up Sidecar."

The name "Hoop La!" is believed to refer to an archaic slang term for an exciting public commotion, evoking a sense of lively enthusiasm.
