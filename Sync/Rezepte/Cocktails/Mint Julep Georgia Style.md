# History
The "Mint Julep Georgia Style" is a historical variation of the classic Mint Julep cocktail, distinguished by its use of peach brandy and common brandy.

The "Julep cocktail," most famously known as the Mint Julep, boasts a rich history and a fascinating evolution from a medicinal concoction to an iconic American drink. The term "julep" itself is derived from the Persian word "gulab" (or Arabic "julab"), meaning rosewater, and historically referred to sweet drinks, often used to make medicine more palatable. The julep's origins can be traced back to Persia, and it reached America in the 18th century, initially as a daily health elixir made with rum or brandy, honey, and muddled mint. By the early 19th century, the julep became a favorite among the Southern elite in America, particularly in Virginia. While initially made with brandy or rum, bourbon gradually became the standard as its production increased in Kentucky.

A crucial element of the Mint Julep is crushed ice, which became more common with the rise of ice houses in the mid-19th century. The drink is traditionally served in a silver or pewter cup, held by the edges to allow frost to form on the outside, enhancing the cooling effect. The Mint Julep has been the official drink of the Kentucky Derby since 1938.

Regarding a "Mint Julep Georgia Style cocktail," one notable historical account from British Captain Frederick Marryat's 1840 book, "Second Series of A Diary in America," describes a "real mint julep" that could be considered a "Georgia Mint Julep." This recipe calls for mint, sugar, water, and equal proportions of peach and common brandy (or cognac). This suggests a historical variation that incorporated peach brandy, a spirit historically associated with the region. This particular recipe features Fresh Mint leaves and sprigs, Sugar Cubes, Peach Brandy, and Brandy, creating a rich and fruity julep.
