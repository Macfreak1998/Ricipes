# History
The "Bronx" cocktail has a rich, albeit debated, history, with its origins generally attributed to the early 1900s in New York City. The most widely accepted story credits Johnny Solon, a bartender at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York, with creating the drink. While the precise date is unknown, it's believed to be sometime in the early 1900s. Solon reportedly named the cocktail after visiting the Bronx Zoo, which opened in 1899. He is said to have joked that customers would tell him about the "strange animals they saw after a lot of mixed drinks."

However, other accounts exist, including some crediting two bartenders in the Bronx itself, or Joseph S. Sormani, a Bronx restaurateur.

The name "Bronx" directly refers to the New York City borough and the Bronx Zoo. The cocktail itself is essentially a variation of a Perfect Martini, which uses equal parts sweet and dry vermouth. The key addition that defines the Bronx cocktail is orange juice, often accompanied by orange bitters. Its typical ingredients include gin, sweet red vermouth, dry vermouth, and fresh orange juice.

The Bronx cocktail held significant popularity in its time, ranking as the third most famous cocktail globally in 1934, following the Martini and the Manhattaccordingly. It even made an appearance in the classic 1934 film "The Thin Maccordingly." It is also notable for being one of the first cocktails to incorporate fresh fruit juice.
