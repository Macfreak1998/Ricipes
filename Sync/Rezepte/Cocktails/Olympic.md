# History
The "Olympic Cocktail" is a classic drink with a history rooted in the early 20th century, primarily known through Harry Craddock's 1930 *The Savoy Cocktail Book*.

The cocktail is widely believed to have been named after the RMS Olympic, a transatlantic ocean liner and the sister ship to the ill-fated Titanic and Britannic. The Olympic was the oldest of the three "Olympic-class" ships built for the White Star Line and was the only one to complete its full service life without sinking. The cocktail's publication in Craddock's book in 1930 came towards the end of the ship's career.

The Olympic Cocktail is considered a "sister drink" to the more famous Sidecar. Both cocktails share a base of Cognac (or brandy) and were originally made with equal parts of their respective ingredients. The key difference lies in the citrus component: the Sidecar uses lemon, while the Olympic Cocktail uses orange juice.

This particular recipe features Orange Juice, Triple Sec, Brandy, and Lemon Juice. It is a variation that includes both orange and lemon juice, creating a balanced sweet and tart profile, while maintaining the brandy base and orange liqueur, making it a refreshing and flavorful tribute to the grand ocean liner.
