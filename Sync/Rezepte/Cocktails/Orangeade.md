# History
Orangeade is a refreshing beverage typically made from orange juice, sweetened water, and sometimes carbonated. The term "orangeade" originated in French, combining the word "orange" with the suffix "-ade," much like "lemonade." Its first known use dates back to 1706.

While the drink itself emerged in the early 18th century, the key ingredient, the sweet orange, has a much older history. Portuguese traders introduced sweet oranges to Europe from India, and they were brought to the Americas by Christopher Columbus in 1493 and by Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de Leon to Florida in 1513.

This particular recipe features Lemon Juice, Simple Syrup, Orange, and Lemon, creating a simple yet effective and refreshing beverage. It is a classic example of a homemade orangeade, perfect for cooling down on a warm day.
