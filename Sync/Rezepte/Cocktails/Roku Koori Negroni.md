# History
The "Roku Koori Negroni" is a modern variation of the classic Negroni cocktail, distinguished by its use of Roku Japanese Craft Gin and the Japanese word "Koori" (氷) for ice.

The classic Negroni cocktail itself has a rich history, dating back to early 20th century Florence, Italy. The most widely accepted origin story attributes its creation to Count Camillo Negroni in 1919. Legend has it that Count Negroni, a regular at Caffè Casoni, asked bartender Fosco Scarselli to strengthen his favorite cocktail, the Americano (made with Campari, sweet vermouth, and soda water). Scarselli obliged by replacing the soda water with gin and garnishing it with an orange slice instead of the Americano's usual lemon, thus creating the Negroni.

The "Roku Koori Negroni" takes this classic foundation and infuses it with a Japanese sensibility. Roku Gin, known for its unique Japanese botanicals like bitter orange peel and yuzu, adds a distinct citrus and floral profile to the traditional Negroni. The emphasis on "Koori" (ice) highlights the Japanese appreciation for precise ice preparation and presentation in cocktails. This variation offers a sophisticated and aromatic twist on a beloved Italian classic.
