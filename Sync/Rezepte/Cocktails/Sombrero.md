# History
The name "Sombrero" cocktail is typically associated with a drink made from coffee liqueur (most commonly Kahlúa) and cream or milk, served over ice. This version originated in the 1950s, and its name is attributed to its Mexican origin and the visual resemblance of the cream floating on top to a sombrero hat.

However, the recipe presented here, with brandy, red port wine, and heavy cream, represents a different interpretation of a "Sombrero" cocktail. While not as widely documented as the coffee liqueur version, some historical cocktail references suggest that the name "Sombrero Cocktail" might have been applied to other brandy-based cream drinks as well. The addition of red port wine in this recipe adds a unique layer of complexity and richness, distinguishing it further.

This particular "Sombrero" cocktail is a rich, dessert-style drink, where the brandy and port provide a robust base, and the cream adds a luxurious texture. Its origins are likely a creative adaptation, possibly from a period when bartenders experimented with different spirits and liqueurs to create creamy, indulgent concoctions.
