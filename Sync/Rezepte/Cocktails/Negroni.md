# History
The "Negroni" is an Italian cocktail made with equal parts gin, sweet red vermouth, and Campari, typically served on the rocks and garnished with an orange slice or peel. It is considered an apéritif, meant to stimulate the appetite before a meal.

**Origin and History:**
The most widely accepted origin story places the Negroni's creation in Florence, Italy, in 1919. Count Camillo Negroni, a regular at Caffè Casoni (now Caffè Giacosa), reportedly asked bartender Fosco Scarselli to strengthen his favorite cocktail, the Americano. Scarselli achieved this by replacing the Americano's soda water with gin and, to signify the new drink, garnished it with an orange slice instead of the usual lemon. Other patrons soon began ordering "one of Count Negroni's drinks," and it eventually became known simply as the Negroni.

The Negroni evolved from earlier cocktails. Its direct predecessor, the Americano, consists of Campari, sweet vermouth, and soda water. The Americano, in turn, is believed to have originated from the Milano-Torino, a drink made with equal parts Campari (from Milan) and rosso vermouth (from Turin).

While the Florentine origin is popular, there's an alternative claim crediting General Pascal Oliver Comte de Negroni, a Frenchman, with introducing a vermouth-based cocktail to the Lunéville Officers Club in Senegal in 1857.

The Negroni gained significant popularity in the 1950s. Notable figures like Orson Welles, who tried the drink in 1947, famously remarked, "The bitters are excellent for your liver, the gin is bad for you. They balance each other." The cocktail has since become a classic, with variations like the Negroni Sbagliato and the White Negroni emerging over time.
