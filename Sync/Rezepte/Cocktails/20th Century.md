# Geschichte
This cocktail is attributed to Brit William J. Tarling who first published it in the Cafe Royale Cocktail Book in 1937. The drink was named after a rail line which stretched between Chicago and New York called The Twentieth Century Limited which ran for 65 years. This line was immensely important because trains were the most civilized way to travel at this point in history and this particular line became famous for luxury. First off ticket holders would tread across a red carpet to get on the train and it is believed that the term "Red Carpet Treatment" was coined for this reason. The train also boasted a Library, single occupancy sleeping berths and in house maid service.
