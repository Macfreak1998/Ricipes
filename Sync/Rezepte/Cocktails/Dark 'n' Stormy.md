# History
The "Dark 'n' Stormy" cocktail boasts a rich history rooted in Bermuda, its origin closely tied to the Gosling Brothers rum company.

The story of the Dark 'n' Stormy begins in the early 19th century with James Gosling, who founded a rum business in Bermuda in 1857. The cocktail itself is believed to have been created after World War I at the Royal Naval Officers Club in Bermuda. British naval officers, who were already consuming ginger beer to alleviate seasickness, began mixing it with the local Gosling's Black Seal rum, leading to the birth of the iconic drink.

The evocative name "Dark 'n' Stormy" is attributed to a sailor. Upon observing the drink's appearance—the dark rum floating atop the ginger beer—the sailor reportedly remarked that it resembled a storm cloud "only a fool or a dead man would sail under." This vivid description perfectly captured the drink's visual characteristics and its maritime heritage.

A significant aspect of the Dark 'n' Stormy's identity is its status as a registered trademark of Gosling Brothers Ltd. of Bermuda. This trademark legally mandates that for a drink to be authentically called a "Dark 'n' Stormy," it must be made with Gosling's Black Seal rum. Gosling Brothers has actively protected this trademark, even pursuing legal action against establishments that use other rums under the "Dark 'n' Stormy" name. The traditional recipe calls for Gosling's Black Seal rum and ginger beer, often garnished with a lime wedge.
