# History
The "Champs-Élysées" cocktail is an elegant, French-inspired drink named after the famous Avenue des Champs-Élysées in Paris, a boulevard that symbolizes elegance, sophistication, and French culture. The name itself, "Champs Élysées," translates to "Elysian Fields" in French.

The cocktail's history traces back to the early 20th century, with its first known appearance in print in the 1925 book "Drinks Long and Short" by Nina Toye and A. H. Adair. Its popularity significantly grew after being featured in Harry Craddock's influential "The Savoy Cocktail Book" in 1930. While some sources suggest Harry MacElhone of Harry's New York Bar in Paris might have created it, with a recipe appearing in his 1922 book, the exact creator and circumstances of its origin remain somewhat elusive.

The Champs-Élysées cocktail is a member of the "sours" category of cocktails and is often considered a variation of the Sidecar. However, it distinguishes itself by replacing the orange liqueur found in a Sidecar with Green Chartreuse, an aromatic French herbal liqueur made by monks from a secret recipe of 130 botanicals. The cocktail's ingredients typically include cognac, Green Chartreuse, lemon juice, simple syrup, and bitters. The use of cognac, a quintessentially French spirit, combined with Green Chartreuse, provides a "double dose of French ingredients" and reflects the refined tastes of the early 20th-century cocktail scene. This combination results in a balanced drink with citrus, herbal complexity, and smooth brandy warmth, offering a deeper, more earthy, and woodsy flavor profile compared to the fruitier notes of a Sidecar.
