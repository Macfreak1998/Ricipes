# History
The "Jasmin" cocktail was created in 1992 by bartender Paul Harrington while he was working at the Townhouse Bar & Grill in Emeryville, California.

Its origin lies in Harrington's adaptation of the Pegu Club cocktail. He maintained the gin and orange liqueur components but substituted lime juice with lemon juice and replaced bitters with Campari.

The meaning behind the name "Jasmin" is quite straightforward and not related to the jasmine flower itself. Paul Harrington named the cocktail after a friend, and because he was unsure of the correct spelling of her name, he opted for the flower's spelling. This name became permanent after the cocktail was featured in his 1998 publication, "Cocktail: The Drinks Bible for the 21st Century."

The Jasmin cocktail is recognized as a "modern classic" due to its balanced, crisp, citrusy, and subtly bitter characteristics. It is often likened to spiked grapefruit juice, offering a bright, zesty, and somewhat bitter taste. This particular recipe includes Gin, Lemon Juice, Campari, and Cointreau, creating a vibrant and balanced drink.
