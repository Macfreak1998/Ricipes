# History
The Americano cocktail, a classic Italian aperitif, boasts a rich history, originating in Milan, Italy, around the 1860s. It was conceived by Gaspare Campari, the creator of the eponymous bitter liqueur, and was initially known as the "Milano-Torino." This earlier version combined Campari (from Milan) and sweet vermouth (from Turin). Bartenders later added soda water, transforming it into the bubbly drink recognized today.

The cocktail's name, "Americano," is widely believed to have been adopted due to its immense popularity among American tourists visiting Italy in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. These American visitors favored a lighter, highball-style drink, which the Americano provided. Another, less prevalent theory suggests the name is an homage to Primo Carnera, an Italian-American boxer who became a heavyweight champion in 1933.

The Americano is composed of three main ingredients: Campari, sweet red vermouth, and a splash of soda water, typically garnished with an orange slice or lemon twist. It is often regarded as the "father" of the even more famous Negroni cocktail, as the Negroni was created by replacing the soda water in an Americano with gin. The Americano also holds a place in popular culture as the first drink ordered by James Bond in Ian Fleming's novel *Casino Royale*.
