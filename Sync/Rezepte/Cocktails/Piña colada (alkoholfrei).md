# History
The non-alcoholic Piña Colada, often referred to as a Virgin Piña Colada, is a direct adaptation of the classic alcoholic Piña Colada. The original Piña Colada is widely believed to have been created in Puerto Rico in the 1950s. Ramón "Monchito" Marrero, a bartender at the Caribe Hilton Hotel in San Juan, is often credited with inventing the drink in 1954, aiming to create a signature cocktail that captured the essence of Puerto Rico.

The name "Piña Colada" translates from Spanish as "strained pineapple," referring to the fresh pineapple juice used in its preparation. The drink gained significant popularity throughout the 1970s and was declared the national drink of Puerto Rico in 1978.

The non-alcoholic version simply omits the rum from the traditional recipe, allowing individuals to enjoy the tropical flavors of pineapple and coconut without alcohol. It has become a popular choice for those who prefer a non-alcoholic option, especially in the growing trend of mocktails.
