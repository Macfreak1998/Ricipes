# History
The "Painkiller" cocktail, a tropical icon, has a rich history rooted in the British Virgin Islands, embodying relaxation and the carefree spirit of island life.

The Painkiller cocktail was created in the 1970s by Daphne Henderson, the owner of the Soggy Dollar Bar on Jost Van Dyke in the British Virgin Islands. The bar earned its name because patrons often had to swim ashore, resulting in "soggy dollar bills."

The drink gained widespread recognition when Charles Tobias, the founder of Pusser's Rum, encountered it. After reportedly reverse-engineering the recipe or convincing Henderson to share it, Tobias began marketing the Painkiller as the signature drink for Pusser's Rum. In the 1980s, Pusser's Rum officially trademarked the name "Painkiller."

The name "Painkiller" suggests its intended effect: a flavorful yet potent elixir designed to soothe both body and soul, offering comfort after long voyages or simply as a means of relaxation. It has become synonymous with tropical getaways, sunsets, and sandy shores, representing escapism and indulgence within tiki culture.

The classic Painkiller recipe typically includes Pusser's Rum, pineapple juice, cream of coconut, and orange juice, often garnished with freshly grated nutmeg. A common ratio for the non-rum ingredients is four parts pineapple juice to one part cream of coconut and one part orange juice. This particular recipe features Navy Strength Rum, Pineapple Juice, Coconut Cream, and Orange Juice, creating a potent and flavorful tropical drink.
