# History
The "Volga Volga" cocktail appears to refer to at least two distinct drinks. The "Volga Boatman" cocktail has a more documented history, with its recipe adapted from David Embury's classic "The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks" and named after a Russian folksong. This version typically includes vodka, orange juice, and cherry brandy.

Another cocktail, simply called "Volga, Volga," is described with ingredients such as Absolut Vodka, Blue Curacao, and Pastis, or with vodka, green crème de menthe, and tonic water, but without specific historical details regarding its origin. The recipe presented here, with vodka, green crème de menthe, and tonic water, aligns with this latter, less historically documented version.

Given the ingredients, this "Volga Volga" is likely a modern creation, possibly inspired by the "Volga Boatman" cocktail due to its Russian connection (vodka) and the evocative name. It offers a refreshing and visually appealing drink, with the green crème de menthe providing a distinct color and minty flavor, complemented by the crispness of tonic water. The year "1979" in the categories might indicate a specific creation date for this particular recipe, placing it within the modern era of cocktail development.
