# History
The "Lichterfest" (German for "Festival of Lights") cocktail is not a historically documented drink with a specific origin story. Instead, it is a themed cocktail, likely created for events or celebrations that involve lights, such as a "Festival of Lights."

The preparation method, which involves igniting a sugar cube soaked in high-proof alcohol, is a technique commonly used in "flaming shots." This theatrical element adds to the festive atmosphere, making the drink visually appealing and exciting. While the specific combination of ingredients may vary, the core idea is to create a drink that embodies the spirit of a "Lichterfest" through its presentation and name.
