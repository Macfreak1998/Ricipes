# History
The "Campari Shakerato" is a simple yet elegant Italian aperitivo consisting solely of Campari and ice, vigorously shaken to achieve a unique texture and flavor. While the precise date of its birth is not documented, it gained popularity in Italian bars around the 1960s, becoming a staple drink. Tommaso Cecca, head bartender at Campari's Camparino in Milan, notes that it's considered the "first cocktail made from just one single ingredient."

Campari itself has a much longer history, invented in 1860 in Novara, Italy, by Gaspare Campari. It's an infusion of herbs and fruits in alcohol and water, known for its distinctive bitter taste and red color.

The "Shakerato" aspect refers to the vigorous shaking process, which is crucial to the drink's character. This aeration imparts a silky mouthfeel to the Campari and cools the drink rapidly by breaking ice into tiny shards. The result is a well-balanced cocktail that offers a blend of bitter and sweet notes with a full body and finish. The technique is paramount due to the single ingredient. A proper Campari Shakerato often involves two back-to-back shakes.
