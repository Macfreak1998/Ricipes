# History
The "Golden Rye Fizz" is a cocktail that combines elements of the classic "Fizz" cocktail family with the distinct flavor profile of rye whiskey. While a specific, detailed origin story for the "Golden Rye Fizz" itself is not widely documented, its history can be understood by examining the origins of its constituent parts: Fizz cocktails, the "Golden Fizz," and rye whiskey.

**Fizz Cocktails:**
The Fizz is a category of mixed drinks that evolved from the older "sours" family of cocktails. Its defining characteristics are the inclusion of an acidic juice (typically lemon or lime) and carbonated water. The "Fix" cocktail, recorded in Jerry Thomas' Bartender's Guide in 1862, featured an alcoholic base, lemon juice, sugar, ice, and water. The "Fizz" emerged by simply replacing the still water with soda, making the drink sparkling and more refreshing. Fizz cocktails became widely popular in America between 1900 and the 1940s, with New Orleans being a notable hub for their popularity.

**The Golden Fizz:**
The "Golden Fizz" is a classic variation of the Gin Fizz, believed to have originated in the United States in the late 19th century and popularized during the Prohibition era. It is distinguished by the addition of an egg yolk, which gives the cocktail its signature golden color and rich, velvety texture. This contrasts with the "Silver Fizz," which uses egg white.

**Rye Whiskey:**
Rye whiskey has a deep history in America, predating bourbon. It was first distilled by farmers in Pennsylvania around 1750. Rye whiskey quickly became a popular spirit for early Americans, especially after the Revolutionary War. The popularity of rye whiskey declined after Prohibition, and it only began to regain its prominence more recently. Rye grain imparts a spicy or fruity flavor to the whiskey.

The "Golden Rye Fizz" combines these elements, featuring Rye Whiskey, Lemon Juice, Simple Syrup, Advocaat, Orange Juice, and Soda Water. Given the history of the "Golden Fizz" as a variation of the Gin Fizz using an egg yolk, and the historical prevalence of rye whiskey, it is highly probable that the "Golden Rye Fizz" emerged as a natural adaptation, substituting gin with rye whiskey in the "Golden Fizz" structure. This would have allowed for a "golden" (egg yolk-inclusive, or in this case, Advocaat for color and richness) fizz cocktail that leveraged the distinct flavor of rye. The golden color and sparkling presentation of the "Golden Rye Fizz" add elegance to the drink.
