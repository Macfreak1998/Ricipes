# History
The "Batida de Limão" is a refreshing Brazilian cocktail with a rich history and cultural significance, evolving from the traditional "batida" cocktail, which dates back to the late 19th or early 20th century. Traditional batidas are known for using cachaça (a Brazilian sugarcane spirit) blended with fruit juice and sugar. The incorporation of lemon juice led to the development of the Lemon Batida. The addition of sweetened condensed milk is a common Brazilian culinary practice, balancing sweet and tangy flavors.

The word "batida" means "shaken" in Portuguese, referring to the cocktail's method of preparation.

The Batida de Limão is closely related to the Caipirinha, Brazil's national cocktail. In fact, the Caipirinha is sometimes referred to as "batida de limão." While both drinks share cachaça, lime, and sugar as core ingredients, a key distinction is that the traditional Caipirinha does not typically include sweetened condensed milk, which is often found in Batida de Limão. The Caipirinha itself is believed to have originated in the interior of São Paulo around 1918, possibly as a remedy for the Spanish flu.
