# History
The "Polar Bear" is a name given to several distinct cocktails, rather than a single historically continuous drink. The version described in this recipe is a dessert-style cocktail, combining vodka, crème de cacao white, and heavy cream. This creates a rich, creamy, and sweet drink, often enjoyed as an after-dinner treat.

Other cocktails sharing the "Polar Bear" name include a modern mezcal-based drink from San Francisco and a chocolate-mint flavored shot (sometimes called "Peppermint Paddy"). There's also a "Danish Polar Bear" made with vodka, blue curaçao, and lemon soda.

While the exact historical development of this specific vodka, crème de cacao, and cream version is not well-documented, it fits within the tradition of creamy, sweet cocktails that became popular in the mid to late 20th century. Its name likely evokes the white, icy appearance and the rich, indulgent nature of the drink.
