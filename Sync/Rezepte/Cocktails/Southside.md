# History
The exact origin of the Southside cocktail is debated, with several theories pointing to its creation in different locations and eras.

One prominent theory links the Southside to Prohibition-era Chicago. During this time, Al Capone's gang on the city's South Side had access to harsh, unpalatable gin, often referred to as "bathtub gin." Bartenders began adding sugar, citrus (lemon and/or lime), and mint to mask the liquor's imperfections, leading to the creation of the Southside cocktail. This contrasts with the North Side gangs, who reportedly smuggled in mellower gin that worked well with ginger ale in a drink called the "Northside."

Another theory suggests the cocktail originated at the South Side Sportsmen's Club in Long Island, New York, in the late 19th century. This club, frequented by figures like Ulysses S. Grant, was known for its Mint Juleps, and the Southside is believed to have evolved from these mint-based drinks.

A third claim attributes the Southside's creation to Manhattan's 21 Club, which operated as a secretive speakeasy during Prohibition. The 21 Club's version is often described as a refined take, focusing on balance with fresh lime, mint, and high-quality gin.

The earliest known written record of a "Southside Fizz" appears in Hugo Enslinn's 1917 "Recipes for Mixed Drinks," a cocktail book published just before Prohibition. This version included both lemon and lime juice, topped with soda water. Regardless of its precise origin, the Southside cocktail typically features gin, lime juice (though sometimes lemon), simple syrup, and fresh mint, offering a refreshing and herbaceous profile.
