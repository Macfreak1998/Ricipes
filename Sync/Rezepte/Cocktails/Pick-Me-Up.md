# History
The "Pick-Me-Up" cocktail refers to a drink, often alcoholic, intended to restore energy, improve mood, or alleviate the effects of over-indulgence. The noun "pick-me-up" itself first appeared between 1865 and 1870, deriving from the verb phrase "pick me up." Historically, in early America, "pick-me-ups" were popular remedies for hangovers and general malaise.

This particular recipe features Lemon Juice, Angostura Bitters, Simple Syrup, Grenadine, Brandy, and Champagne. This combination creates a vibrant, effervescent, and complex drink. The brandy provides a warming base, while the lemon juice adds a tart citrus note. Grenadine and simple syrup contribute sweetness and color, and Angostura bitters add aromatic complexity. Topped with champagne, it becomes a celebratory and invigorating beverage, designed to be both refreshing and uplifting.
