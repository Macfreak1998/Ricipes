# History
The "Mexican Colada" is a sophisticated variation of the classic "Piña Colada," blending traditional Caribbean flavors with Mexican influences. While "Mexican Colada" is not a historically recognized cocktail with a distinct origin, it is a creative interpretation that builds upon the well-documented history of the Piña Colada.

The name "Piña Colada" literally translates from Spanish as "strained pineapple," referring to the fresh pineapple juice used in its preparation. This iconic cocktail is typically made with rum, cream of coconut, and pineapple juice, often served blended or shaken with ice. Its origin is widely believed to be in Puerto Rico, though the exact creator is a subject of debate, with Ramón "Monchito" Marrero (1954 at Caribe Hilton) and Ramón Portas Mingot (1963 at Barrachina Restaurant) being the most prominent claimants. In 1978, the Piña Colada was officially declared Puerto Rico's national drink.

This "Mexican Colada" recipe features Heavy Cream, Coconut Cream, Pineapple Juice, Coffee Liqueur (like Kahlúa), and Tequila Blanco. The addition of Tequila and Coffee Liqueur introduces a deeper, more complex flavor profile, with the agave notes of tequila and the rich coffee flavor, creating a luxurious and flavorful twist on the classic Piña Colada. It is a testament to the versatility of the Piña Colada template, allowing for creative adaptations that enhance its flavor and cultural fusion.
