# History
The "Lemondrive Mai Tai" cocktail is a modern and creative drink that does not have a widely documented historical origin. It is a variation of the classic "Mai Tai" cocktail, with the "Lemondrive" in its name likely referring to a specific brand, a creative element, or a particular flavor profile.

The **Mai Tai** cocktail has a rich and somewhat debated history, with its origin primarily attributed to Victor "Trader Vic" Bergeron in 1944 at his restaurant in Oakland, California. Bergeron stated he created the Mai Tai for friends from Tahiti, aiming to highlight the flavors of a 17-year-old Jamaican rum. His original recipe included aged Jamaican rum, fresh lime juice, orgeat syrup (almond syrup), orange curaçao, and a dash of simple syrup. Donn Beach, also known as Don the Beachcomber, also claimed to have created a similar drink in the 1930s. The name "Mai Tai" comes from the Tahitian phrase "Maita'i roa ae!" (or "Mai Tai-Roa Aé"), meaning "out of this world, the best."

This "Lemondrive Mai Tai" recipe features Havana Rum, Dry Orange, Lime Juice, Lemon Juice, and Orgeat. It takes the core elements of a Mai Tai (rum, orange liqueur, citrus, orgeat) and introduces a blend of lime and lemon juice, along with a specific rum choice, creating a unique and refreshing tropical drink. It embodies the spirit of adaptation and creativity in mixology, building upon a historical classic to create a new, distinct experience.
