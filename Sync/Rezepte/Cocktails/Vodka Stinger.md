# History
The Vodka Stinger is a modern twist on the classic Stinger cocktail, which has a history dating back to the late 19th century.

The original Stinger cocktail, a duo of brandy (often Cognac) and crème de menthe, emerged around the 1890s in the United States. Its origins are somewhat murky, but it is believed to have evolved from "The Judge," a cocktail featured in William Schmidt's 1892 book "The Flowing Bowl." The name "Stinger" was officially adopted in Jacques Straub's "Straub's Manual of Mixed Drinks" in 1913.

Initially popular in New York City, the Stinger quickly became known as a "society" drink, favored by the upper classes. Millionaire Reginald Vanderbilt is often credited with popularizing the drink. The Stinger maintained its popularity in America until the 1970s.

The Vodka Stinger substitutes vodka for the brandy in the original recipe. This variation likely gained traction as clear spirits like vodka grew in popularity. Its presence in popular culture, such as the line "another Vodka Stinger!" in Stephen Sondheim's 1970 musical "Company," suggests its emergence and recognition during that era. A recipe for the Vodka Stinger also appeared in Stan Jones' 1977 "Jones' Complete Barguide." This recipe, with vodka and crème de menthe white, is a classic example of this simple and refreshing cocktail.
