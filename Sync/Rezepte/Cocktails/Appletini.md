# History
The Appletini, also known as an Apple Martini, is a cocktail that gained immense popularity in the 1990s. Its creation is widely attributed to bartender Adam Karsten at Lola's restaurant in West Hollywood in 1997. The story goes that the owner, Loren "Lola" Dunsworth, wanted a new signature cocktail, and Karsten mixed Ketel One vodka with sour apple schnapps, creating a drink that tasted like a Jolly Rancher candy.

The cocktail was originally named the "Adam's Apple Martini" but was later shortened to "Apple Martini" or "Appletini." It quickly became a cultural phenomenon, known for its vibrant green color and sweet and sour apple flavor. While there were earlier drinks that mixed vodka and apple juice, the modern Appletini is defined by the use of apple schnapps or pucker.
