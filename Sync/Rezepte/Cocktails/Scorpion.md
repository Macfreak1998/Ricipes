# History
The Scorpion cocktail, a prominent fixture in tiki culture, traces its origins back to the late 1930s in Honolulu. An unidentified bartender at a bar called The Hut is credited with its initial creation. This early version reportedly used Okolehao, a Hawaiian moonshine made from fermented Ti plant, along with various fruit juices.

Victor "Trader Vic" Bergeron encountered this drink during a visit to Honolulu. He was particularly impressed by its presentation in a large communal bowl. Inspired, he returned to his restaurant in Oakland, California, and developed his own variation of the cocktail, substituting the hard-to-find Okolehao with rum.

Trader Vic heavily modified the Scorpion recipe over the years, publishing several versions. His 1947 "Bartender's Guide" featured a "Scorpion Punch" designed to serve twelve people. He continued to refine the recipe, and his 1972 edition of "Trader Vic's Bartender's Guide" included both a single-serve Scorpion cocktail and an updated Scorpion Bowl recipe. The individual cocktail typically featured light rum, brandy (or cognac), orange juice, lemon juice, and orgeat syrup, often blended with shaved ice.

The Scorpion cocktail became one of Trader Vic's most popular drinks, and is recognized for its potent, fruity flavor and often elaborate presentation in communal bowls. This recipe, with light rum, cognac, orange juice, lemon juice, simple syrup, and orgeat, is a classic interpretation of this iconic tiki cocktail.
