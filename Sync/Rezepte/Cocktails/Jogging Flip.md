# History
The "Jogging Flip" cocktail is a modern and creative drink that does not have a widely documented historical origin. It is a variation of the classic "Flip" cocktail, with the "Jogging" in its name likely referring to its refreshing and perhaps "healthy" (due to the inclusion of various fruit juices) nature.

The "Flip cocktail" has a rich history, originating in England in the late 17th century. Initially, Flips were made by heating a mixture of ale, rum or brandy, and molasses or sugar with a red-hot poker, causing the drink to froth or "flip." Over time, the recipe evolved significantly. Eggs were introduced, the amount of sugar increased, and the ale was eventually removed. The preparation method also changed, moving away from the hot poker to being shaken cold in a cocktail shaker. The first bar guide to feature the Flip was Jerry Thomas's "How to Mix Drinks" in 1862. Today, a Flip is generally understood as a cocktail containing a whole raw egg (or just the yolk), sugar, and a base spirit or fortified wine.

This "Jogging Flip" recipe features various juices (such as lemon, orange, and grapefruit juice), Egg Yolk, and Grenadine. It is notable for being a non-alcoholic or low-alcohol Flip, focusing on the refreshing qualities of fruit juices and the creamy texture provided by the egg yolk, with grenadine adding a touch of sweetness and color. It offers a unique take on the traditional Flip, emphasizing a lighter, fruit-forward profile.
