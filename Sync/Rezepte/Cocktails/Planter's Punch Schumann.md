# History
The Planter's Punch is a classic rum cocktail with a history rooted in the West Indies, particularly Jamaica, dating back to the late 18th or early 19th century. It was originally a refreshing concoction of rum, citrus, and sugar, enjoyed by plantation owners and workers. The drink is famously associated with a rhyming formula: "One of sour, two of sweet, three of strong, and four of weak."

This particular recipe, "Planter's Punch Schumann," is an interpretation of the classic cocktail by Charles Schumann, a renowned German barkeeper and restaurateur. Charles Schumann opened his influential Schumann's Bar in Munich in 1982 and is known for his significant contributions to contemporary bartending and his cocktail books. While the Planter's Punch predates Schumann's career by over a century, this recipe represents his specific take on the timeless drink, often characterized by his meticulous approach to classic cocktails.
