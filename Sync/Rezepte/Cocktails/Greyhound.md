# History
The "Greyhound" cocktail, a simple yet refreshing drink, has a history rooted in mid-20th century America.

The Greyhound cocktail is believed to have originated in the United States in the 1930s. An early version, described as a "grapefruit cocktail" in Harry Craddock's 1930 "The Savoy Cocktail Book," combined gin with grapefruit jelly and ice. Initially, the cocktail was made with gin and grapefruit juice.

The name "Greyhound" was officially adopted around 1945, appearing in Harper's Magazine. The cocktail earned its name from the Greyhound Bus Company, as it was a popular drink served at the Post House restaurants located in their bus terminals.

While originally made with gin, vodka became the spirit of choice for the Greyhound in the 1940s and 1950s due to its rising popularity and neutral flavor, which complements the tangy taste of grapefruit juice. The Greyhound is celebrated for its simplicity, requiring just two main ingredients (vodka or gin and grapefruit juice), and its refreshing, tart profile. It played a role in popularizing citrus-based cocktails in the American cocktail scene. A well-known variation of the Greyhound, featuring a salted rim, is called a "Salty Dog."
