# History
The September Morn cocktail is believed to have been named after Paul Chabas's 1912 painting of the same name. The painting, which depicted a nude woman, caused a significant stir and controversy in the United States, particularly when it was accused of indecency by the mayor of Chicago. This notoriety contributed to the painting's widespread popularity, and a cocktail soon followed, bearing its name.

The earliest known references to the September Morn cocktail appeared in three different cocktail books published in 1917, each presenting a distinct recipe. While some early versions used gin as the base spirit, others, and eventually the more common renditions, featured rum. A consistent ingredient across these early variations was lime juice.

By the 1920s and 1930s, the cocktail's recipe largely standardized to a rum-based drink, incorporating grenadine and egg white. A. S. Crockett included the September Morn in his 1931 manual, "The Old Waldorf-Astoria bar book." Some cocktail historians suggest that the September Morn can be seen as a Caribbean-inspired variation of the Clover Club cocktail, substituting rum for gin. This recipe, with white rum, lime juice, simple syrup, grenadine, and egg white, aligns with the classic rum-based interpretation of this historically intriguing cocktail.
