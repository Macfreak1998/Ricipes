# History
The "South of the Border" cocktail does not appear to have a single, definitive historical origin or inventor. Instead, the name is applied to various cocktail recipes, often featuring ingredients with Mexican associations, such as tequila or Kahlúa. This suggests that "South of the Border" is a thematic name rather than a historically singular drink.

The name itself likely alludes to Mexico, given the common use of tequila and coffee liqueur in these drinks. This particular recipe, with tequila blanco, coffee liqueur, and lime juice, is a classic example of a simple, yet flavorful, tequila-based cocktail that evokes the vibrant flavors often associated with Mexican cuisine and culture. The combination of tequila and coffee liqueur provides a unique balance of earthy and sweet notes, while the lime juice adds a refreshing tartness. It's a straightforward and enjoyable drink that captures the essence of its thematic name.
