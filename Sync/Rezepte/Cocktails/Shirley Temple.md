# History
The Shirley Temple is a non-alcoholic mixed drink, or "mocktail," named after the famous child actress Shirley Temple. It traditionally consists of ginger ale, a splash of grenadine, and is garnished with a maraschino cherry. Modern recipes may also use lemon-lime soda, lemonade, or orange juice.

The exact origin of the Shirley Temple drink is debated, with several establishments claiming its invention in the 1930s. One popular account suggests a bartender at Chasen's in West Hollywood, California, created the drink for Shirley Temple so she could have a sophisticated-looking beverage like the adults. Another claim attributes the drink to the Brown Derby Restaurant in Hollywood. Regardless of its precise origin, the drink was created to provide a non-alcoholic option for young Shirley Temple when she was dining with adults.

Interestingly, Shirley Temple herself was not a fan of the drink, describing it as "saccharine sweet" and "icky." Despite her personal dislike, she was protective of her name associated with the drink. The Shirley Temple became a sensation in the 1930s and has remained a popular non-alcoholic beverage, often served as an alternative to alcoholic cocktails. This recipe, with Sprite, ginger ale, and grenadine, is a classic example of this iconic mocktail.
