# History
The "Cardinal" cocktail, also known as Cardinale, is a classic aperitif with a rich history rooted in 1950s Rome.

The cocktail was created by bartender Giovanni Raimondo at the Hotel Excelsior in Rome, Italy, around 1950.

The name "Cardinale" (Italian for Cardinal) was given in honor of a visiting cardinal, often identified as New York Cardinal Spellman or a German cardinal, who was in Rome for Pope Pius XII's Holy Jubilee year. The cocktail's distinctive vibrant red hue was specifically designed to match the color of the cardinal's robes.

Initially, the Cardinale cocktail's recipe consisted of three parts dry gin, two parts Riesling wine, and one part Campari Bitter Liqueur. Over time, the Riesling wine was often replaced with dry vermouth, leading to a drier profile. In 2024, the International Bartenders Association (IBA) officially recognized the Cardinale, standardizing its recipe to 40ml dry gin, 20ml dry vermouth, and 10ml Campari Bitter Liqueur. This modern iteration is often considered a variation of the Negroni, sometimes referred to as a "Dry Negroni," due to the substitution of dry vermouth for the sweet vermouth typically found in a Negroni.
