# History
The "Mandeville cocktail" is a rum-based drink that often includes light rum, dark rum, lemon juice, grenadine, absinthe (or Pernod), and cola. While its exact historical origin is not definitively documented, it is most likely named after Mandeville, a city in Jamaica.

The cocktail is characterized by its strong rum presence and a flavor profile that some describe as an attempt to recreate the taste of Jägermeister, with notes of sweet cola, caramel from dark rum, tartness from lemon and fruit, and the herbal, licorice flavor of absinthe. It has also been described as an elevated version of a Cuba Libre, with the addition of Pernod contributing an anise flavor and a subtle "Tiki feel." The garnish of an orange slice can enhance the citrus notes of the lemon juice and cola.

This particular recipe features Lemon Juice, Grenadine, Pernod, White Rum, Dark Rum, and Cola, creating a complex and flavorful tropical drink with a distinct herbal and anise note from the Pernod.
