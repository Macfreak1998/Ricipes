# History
The "Martin's Rum-Orange Punch," as presented in this recipe, is a modern and creative drink that does not have a widely documented historical origin. The "Martin's" in its name likely refers to a specific person or establishment, and it is a variation within the broader category of rum punches.

**History and Origin of Punch and Rum Punch:**
Punch is considered one of the oldest cocktails, with its origins tracing back to 17th-century India. English sailors and merchants of the British East India Company encountered the drink during their voyages, adapting local ingredients to create a refreshing beverage. The first written recipe for punch dates back to 1638. Punch gained popularity in Europe, particularly in England, where it became a convivial drink. Initially, spirits like East Indian arrack were used, but West Indian rum eventually became the primary spirit. The drink was often served in large bowls, symbolizing sociability and sharing. The addition of orange juice to punch recipes became popular in the 18th century.

The word "punch" is widely believed to be derived from the Hindi word "paanch," meaning "five," referring to the traditional five ingredients of punch: alcohol, sugar, lemon or lime, water, and spices.

This "Martin's Rum-Orange Punch" recipe features Lemon Juice, Lime Juice, Simple Syrup, Orange Juice, Bourbon, Dark Rum, and Overproof Rum. It is a complex rum and whiskey-based punch, combining the rich flavors of various rums and bourbon with the tartness of lemon and lime, the sweetness of simple syrup, and the fruity notes of orange. It can be served hot or cold, offering a versatile and flavorful interpretation of the classic rum punch.
