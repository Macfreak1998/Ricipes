# History
The "Trinity cocktail" refers to several distinct drink recipes, often named for their three primary ingredients or a thematic connection. The recipe presented here, with gin, dry vermouth, and blanc vermouth, aligns with the classic 1930 Trinity Cocktail documented in Harry Craddock's *Savoy Cocktail Book*.

This classic version is a simple yet elegant concoction made with equal parts gin, dry vermouth, and sweet vermouth (or blanc vermouth, as used in this recipe). It is often described as a sweeter variation of a martini, showcasing a harmonious balance of its three main components. The name "Trinity" itself suggests this balance or harmony of its ingredients.

While other cocktails bearing the "Trinity" name exist, such as a more intricate recipe from David Embury's 1948 *The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks* or modern interpretations, this particular version from the *Savoy Cocktail Book* is a well-established classic. It offers a sophisticated and spirit-forward drink, perfect for those who appreciate the nuanced interplay of gin and vermouth.
