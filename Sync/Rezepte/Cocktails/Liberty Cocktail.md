# History
The "Liberty Cocktail" is a name associated with drinks that evoke a sense of American independence and freedom, often drawing inspiration from symbols like the Liberty Bell or historical events. While the exact origin and creator of a universally recognized "Liberty Cocktail" are not definitively known, various interpretations exist.

This particular recipe, featuring Lime, a Sugar Cube, Calvados, and White or Dark Rum, is a unique interpretation of a "Liberty Cocktail." It combines the crisp, apple notes of Calvados with the tropical warmth of rum, balanced by the tartness of lime and the sweetness of a sugar cube. This blend creates a refreshing and spirit-forward drink. While some "Liberty Cocktails" are known to feature Applejack, this recipe's inclusion of Calvados (a French apple brandy) adds a distinct European flair to the American-inspired name, offering a sophisticated and intriguing profile.
