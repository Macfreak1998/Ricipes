# History
The "Apple Martini," often shortened to "Appletini," is a popular cocktail known for its sweet and tangy flavor. It typically consists of vodka and one or more apple-flavored ingredients such as apple juice, apple cider, apple liqueur, or apple brandy. Although served in a martini glass, it deviates from a traditional martini as it usually does not contain vermouth.

The modern Appletini's origin is widely credited to bartender Adam Karsten, who created it in 1996 (or 1997) at Lola's West Hollywood restaurant. It was initially named "Adam's Apple Martini" after him before evolving into the "Apple Martini" or "Appletini." Earlier versions of a vodka and apple juice mix, such as Smirnoff's "Adam's Apple" in the 1970s, also existed.

The Appletini rose to prominence in the late 1990s and early 2000s, becoming a trendsetting cocktail, particularly among a younger, trendier demographic. Its popularity led to numerous appearances in pop culture, including TV shows like "Scrubs" and the movie "The Social Network," where Mark Zuckerberg reportedly declared it "Facebook's official drink." Despite its widespread appeal, some cocktail purists initially dismissed it for straying from the classic martini formula.
