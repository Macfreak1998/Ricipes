# History
The "Kamikaze" cocktail has a rich and somewhat debated history, with its name, origin, and meaning intertwined with Japanese culture and the cocktail's potent nature.

**Meaning:**
The word "Kamikaze" translates to "divine wind" in Japanese. This term originally referred to the typhoons that, in the 13th century, famously dispersed Mongol invasion fleets threatening Japaccordingly. Later, during World War II, it was used to describe Japanese suicide pilots. The cocktail's name is said to reflect its strong, "packs a punch" character, implying a powerful and perhaps overwhelming effect on the drinker.

**Origin:**
There are several theories regarding the Kamikaze cocktail's exact origin:
*   **Post-WWII Japan:** One prominent theory suggests the drink was invented at an American naval base in Japan shortly after World War II. It was supposedly named after the Japanese kamikaze pilots, though it didn't achieve widespread popularity until the 1970s.
*   **1970s Disco Era:** Other accounts place its emergence within the vibrant disco scene of the 1970s. A 1979 *Ski Magazine* article indicates the Kamikaze first appeared in Florida in the early to mid-1970s before gaining popularity in New York and across the United States. Another theory credits New York bartender Tony Lauriano, who, in 1972 at Les Pyrenees restaurant, created a drink he initially called "Jesus Christ Superstar." The name was later changed to Kamikaze due to its strength and the original name being deemed unusual.

**Composition and Evolution:**
Regardless of its precise origin, the Kamikaze cocktail is consistently described as a simple yet potent mix of equal parts vodka, triple sec (or another orange liqueur), and fresh lime juice. It is often compared to a Margarita but with vodka instead of tequila. Initially, the Kamikaze was often served as a shot. Over time, it evolved into a full-sized cocktail, typically presented in a chilled glass, suchs as a Martini or coupe glass. Its popularity in the 1970s and 1980s was significant, even inspiring other well-known cocktails, such as the Cosmopolitan, which is essentially a cranberry variation of the Kamikaze.
