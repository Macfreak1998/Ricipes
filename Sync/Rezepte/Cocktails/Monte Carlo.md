# History
The "Monte Carlo cocktail" is a classic drink whose exact origin remains largely unknown, though its recipe first appeared in cocktail books in the late 1930s and 1940s. Some sources credit Hyman Gale & Gerald F. Marco's 1937 publication "The How and When," while others point to David Embury's 1948 edition of "The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks."

The cocktail is essentially a variation of a Manhattan or an Old Fashioned. It distinguishes itself by replacing the sweet vermouth found in a Manhattan with Bénédictine, an herbal French liqueur. Typically served over ice, it shares a resemblance to the Old Fashioned. The name "Monte Carlo" refers to the prominent ward of Monaco, evoking a sense of European glamour and sophistication.

The Monte Carlo cocktail is made with rye whiskey, Bénédictine, and Angostura bitters. The Bénédictine, an herbal liqueur with 27 botanicals, imparts a honeyed texture and notes of ginger, saffron, citrus, and baking spices, contributing to a slightly sweeter and more herbaceous flavor profile. Angostura bitters further enhance the cardamom, clove, and peppery notes of the rye. To balance the sweetness, a higher-proof rye whiskey is often recommended.
