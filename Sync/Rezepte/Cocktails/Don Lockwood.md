# History
The "Don Lockwood" cocktail was created around 2012 by Abraham Hawkins at the Dutch Kills bar in New York.

The cocktail is named after Don Lockwood, the character played by Gene Kelly in the 1952 film "Singin' in the Rain." The name reflects the character's motto of "dignity, always dignity" and the drink's balance of ruggedness and elegance, mirroring Lockwood's public and private personas.

It is a variation of the classic Old Fashioned, featuring a split base of bourbon and peaty Scotch whisky, complemented by maple syrup, Angostura bitters, and chocolate bitters.
