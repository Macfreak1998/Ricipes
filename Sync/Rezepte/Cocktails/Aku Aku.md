# History
The "Aku Aku" cocktail is a classic tiki cocktail created by Victor Bergeron, famously known as Trader Vic, at his renowned Trader Vic's bar in San Francisco. While some sources suggest its creation in the 1930s, others indicate the 1950s, or that it was adapted from a recipe in his 1972 "Trader Vic's Bartender's Guide." The Aku Aku is often considered a variation of Don the Beachcomber's "Missionary's Downfall" cocktail. The cocktail's name is also associated with the Aku Aku restaurant at the Stardust Hotel in Las Vegas, a tiki-themed establishment that opened in 1960, for which Donn Beach was commissioned to design the menu and ambiance.

The name "Aku Aku" is derived from Polynesian mythology, referring to spirits that protect sacred places. In Easter Island words, "Aku Aku" can mean "spiritual guide." One interpretation also describes an "Aku Aku" as a "ghost that walks," specifically a "demon ghost" that can manifest as either male or female. The name also gained prominence from Thor Heyerdahl's 1957 book, "Aku-Aku: the Secret of Easter Island," which detailed his archaeological expedition to Easter Island.
