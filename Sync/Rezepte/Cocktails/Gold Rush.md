# History
The "Gold Rush" cocktail originated in the early 2000s at the renowned Milk & Honey bar in New York City. It was created by bartender T.J. Siegal.

Siegal's intention was to offer a modern twist on classic whiskey drinks. The cocktail draws inspiration from the Prohibition-era Bee's Knees, which traditionally uses gin, by substituting bourbon for gin. It can also be seen as a variation of a Whiskey Sour, replacing simple syrup with honey syrup.

Regarding its name, Siegal reportedly chose "Gold Rush" because he preferred names that evoke a feeling or a chuckle, rather than having a hidden meaning tied to the drink's origin. However, some sources also suggest the name reflects the cocktail's yellow to light orange color.

The Gold Rush cocktail is known for its simplicity and rich flavor profile, combining bourbon, fresh lemon juice, and honey syrup. It quickly became a classic at Milk & Honey and is now recognized as a modern classic globally.
