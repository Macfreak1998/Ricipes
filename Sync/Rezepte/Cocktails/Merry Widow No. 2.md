# History
The "Merry Widow No. 2" cocktail, as presented in this recipe, is a modern and unique interpretation that draws its name from the classic "Merry Widow cocktail." While the original "Merry Widow cocktail" has a rich history tied to the popular operetta "The Merry Widow" (which premiered in Vienna in 1905) and first appeared in Hugo Ensslin's "Recipes for Mixed Drinks" (1916/1917), this "No 2" version offers a distinct flavor profile.

The original "Merry Widow cocktail" is often characterized as a sophisticated, vermouth-forward martini variation with a distinctive herbal and spicy profile, typically including gin, French vermouth, Bénédictine, Peychaud's bitters, and absinthe.

This "Merry Widow No. 2" recipe features Dry Vermouth, Sweet Vermouth, Vodka, Orange Bitters, and Lemon Peel. It deviates significantly from the gin-based original, instead offering a vodka-based Martini-style drink. The inclusion of both dry and sweet vermouth makes it a "perfect" Martini variation, while the vodka provides a clean base, allowing the vermouths and orange bitters to shine. This creates a balanced and sophisticated drink, offering a modern twist on a classic name.
