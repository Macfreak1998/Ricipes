# History
The "Aka Nui" cocktail appears to be a variation or alternative name for the classic Tiki drink "Nui Nui," created by Don the Beachcomber (Ernest Raymond Beaumont-Gantt) in the 1930s. Don the Beachcomber is widely recognized as the pioneer of the Tiki movement, which popularized rum-based, tropical-themed drinks.

The original recipe for the "Nui Nui" was an unpublished recipe from the personal journal of Don the Beachcomber's maître d', Dick Santiago. While the exact meaning of "Nui Nui" in the context of the cocktail isn't explicitly stated in all sources, it's noted that "nui" means "big" in Rapa Nui.

The "Nui Nui" is known for its bold orange flavors and tropical spices, typically combining rum with fruit juices (like lime and orange) and specialty syrups such as cinnamon syrup and vanilla syrup, often with a dash of Angostura bitters and allspice dram. The "Aka Nui" recipe shares many of these tropical and rum-based characteristics.
