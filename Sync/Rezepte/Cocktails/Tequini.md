# History
The Tequini cocktail is a variation of the classic Martini, believed to have originated in the 1960s. Its name is a portmanteau combining "tequila" and "Martini," reflecting its nature as a tequila-based twist on the iconic gin or vodka cocktail.

This cocktail substitutes tequila for the gin typically found in a Martini, and often includes dry vermouth and sometimes a dash of Angostura aromatic bitters. It is typically served straight up in a chilled Martini glass with a twist of lemon or lime, or an olive. The Tequini reflects the growing popularity and versatility of tequila beyond traditional margaritas, offering a modern twist on a celebrated classic. This recipe, with tequila blanco, dry vermouth, and Angostura bitters, is a classic example of this elegant and spirit-forward cocktail.
