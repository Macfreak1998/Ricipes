# History
The "Manhattan" cocktail, a timeless classic, boasts a rich history, a somewhat debated origin, and a clear meaning in its composition and cultural impact.

**History and Origin:**
The exact origin of the Manhattan cocktail is shrouded in some mystery, a common trait among classic cocktails. The most widely circulated, though likely mythical, story attributes its creation to Dr. Iain Marshall at the Manhattan Club in New York City in the mid-1870s. This drink was supposedly concocted for a banquet hosted by Jennie Jerome (Lady Randolph Churchill, Winston Churchill's mother) in honor of presidential candidate Samuel J. Tilden. However, this account is largely debunked as Lady Randolph Churchill was in France and pregnant at the time, making her presence at the New York banquet improbable.

A more plausible origin story, recounted by bartender William F. Mulhall of New York's Hoffman House in the 1880s, credits a bartender named Black. Black reportedly invented the Manhattan cocktail at his bar on Broadway, ten doors below Houston Street, in the 1860s. This theory is supported by research from cocktail historian David Wondrich. Regardless of the precise inventor, the drink emerged around the 1860s or 1870s in New York City.

**Meaning (Composition):**
The Manhattan is defined by its core ingredients: whiskey, sweet vermouth, and bitters. While rye whiskey is traditionally preferred, other whiskies like Canadian whisky, bourbon, blended whiskey, and Tennessee whiskey are also commonly used. The cocktail is typically stirred with ice, strained into a chilled cocktail glass, and garnished with a maraschino cherry.

The Manhattan is considered one of the first "modern cocktails" because it incorporated an aromatized and fortified wine, vermouth, into its recipe, distinguishing it from earlier whiskey cocktails. This blend creates a balanced, multidimensional taste with subtle bitterness, herbal undertones, and a hint of sweetness.

**Cultural Significance:**
The Manhattan cocktail quickly gained popularity among New York society's elite and has since maintained its iconic status. It has evolved over the decades, with bartenders experimenting with different types of whiskey and bitters, solidifying its place as a versatile and beloved drink. The Manhattan has made numerous appearances in popular culture, from classic films to modern TV shows, often depicted as the drink of choice for discerning characters, further cementing its enduring appeal. It is also one of five cocktails named for a New York City borough.
