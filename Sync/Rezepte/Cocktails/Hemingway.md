# History
The cocktail in this recipe, featuring Pernod and Champagne, is a direct reference to Ernest Hemingway's "Death in the Afternoon" cocktail. While a "Hemingway cocktail" typically refers to a Daiquiri variation, Hemingway himself created this specific drink.

Ernest Hemingway, the famous American novelist, was known for his love of strong drinks. He created the "Death in the Afternoon" cocktail, which he published in his 1935 cocktail book *Death in the Afternoon*. The original recipe calls for one jigger of absinthe poured into a Champagne glass, topped with iced Champagne until it achieves an opalescent milkiness. Pernod, an anise-flavored spirit, is a direct successor to absinthe, making this recipe a faithful interpretation of Hemingway's creation.

The name "Death in the Afternoon" is also the title of Hemingway's 1932 non-fiction book about bullfighting. The cocktail's name and its potent combination of absinthe and Champagne reflect Hemingway's adventurous spirit and his appreciation for strong, impactful drinks. It is a unique and historically significant cocktail, directly linked to one of the 20th century's most celebrated authors.
