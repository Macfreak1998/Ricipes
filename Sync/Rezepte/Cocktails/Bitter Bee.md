# History
The "Bitter Bee" cocktail originated at the renowned Milk & Honey bar in New York City, with its creation estimated to be around 2005-2008. It is also served at The Varnish in Downtown Los Angeles, which is an offshoot of Milk & Honey.

The name "Bitter Bee" is a clever play on its key ingredients: "Bee" refers to the honey used in the cocktail, while "Bitter" highlights the significant presence of Angostura bitters.

While some sources suggest it draws inspiration from the 1920s rum drink, The Queen's Park Swizzle, others describe it as a sophisticated variation of the classic Bee's Knees cocktail, enhanced by the addition of aromatic bitters for increased complexity. Despite its name, the cocktail is generally characterized as a balanced drink that is tart, gently sweet, and refreshingly herbal, rather than intensely bitter.
