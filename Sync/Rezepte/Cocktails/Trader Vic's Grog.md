# History
The Trader Vic's Grog is a classic cocktail deeply rooted in the history of Tiki culture, a movement largely popularized by Victor Jules Bergeron, Jr., who founded the Trader Vic's restaurant and bar chain in 1934. This iconic drink is a staple of the Trader Vic's brand, known for its blend of dark rum, passion fruit syrup, pineapple juice, lemon juice, and aromatic bitters.

The term "grog" itself predates the Tiki era, originating in the British Royal Navy in the 1700s. Vice Admiral Edward Vernon, known as "Old Grog," mandated in 1740 that sailors' rum rations be diluted with water. To improve the taste, sailors were later allowed to add lime juice and sugar, a practice that also inadvertently helped prevent scurvy.

In the mid-20th century, Tiki pioneers like Donn Beach (Don the Beachcomber) and Trader Vic adapted the "grog" concept into elaborate rum-based cocktails. Trader Vic also developed other "grog" variations, like the Voodoo Grog around 1950, showcasing his innovative approach to cocktail creation.

Today, "grog" has evolved within Tiki culture to represent a broad category of rum-based drinks, often bearing little resemblance to the original naval ration but carrying the rich history of rum and tropical cocktails. The Trader Vic's Grog remains a testament to this evolution. This recipe, with dark Jamaican rum, lemon juice, pineapple juice, passion fruit syrup, and Angostura bitters, is a classic example of this iconic tiki cocktail.
