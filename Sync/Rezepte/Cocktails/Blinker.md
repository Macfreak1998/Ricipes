# History
The Blinker is a Prohibition-era cocktail that first appeared in Patrick Gavin Duffy's 1934 book "The Official Mixer's Manual," published just one year after Prohibition ended. The name likely refers to the traffic signal "blinker" or the act of blinking at the drink's vibrant pink-orange color.

The original recipe called for rye whiskey, grapefruit juice, and grenadine (real pomegranate syrup), creating a tart, fruity variation on the classic whiskey sour. The combination of rye's spice with grapefruit's bitterness and grenadine's sweetness creates a beautifully balanced drink with a striking color.

Like many Prohibition-era cocktails, the Blinker fell into obscurity for decades as cocktail culture declined in the mid-20th century. The drink was nearly forgotten until cocktail historian and author Ted "Dr. Cocktail" Haigh revived it in his groundbreaking 2004 book "Vintage Spirits and Forgotten Cocktails."

Haigh's research brought the Blinker back to life, though he made one significant modification to the original recipe: he substituted raspberry syrup for grenadine, creating a different flavor profile that some bartenders prefer. This sparked an ongoing debate in the cocktail community about which version is "correct."

**The Great Blinker Debate:**
- **Original (1934)**: Grenadine (pomegranate) creates a more tart, complex drink with pomegranate's tannic quality balancing grapefruit's bitterness
- **Haigh Version (2004)**: Raspberry syrup makes a sweeter, fruitier drink with berry notes that some find more approachable

Modern craft bartenders have embraced both versions, with many bars offering the grenadine version as the "classic" and the raspberry as a "Ted Haigh variation." The key is using real grenadine (made from pomegranate) or quality raspberry syrup, not artificial substitutes.

The Blinker represents the creative spirit of Prohibition-era bartenders who experimented with fruit juices and syrups to create new flavor combinations. Its rediscovery helped fuel the craft cocktail movement's interest in forgotten pre-Prohibition and Prohibition-era recipes.

The drink's balance of whiskey spice, grapefruit tartness, and fruity sweetness makes it an excellent introduction to whiskey cocktails for those who find Old Fashioneds or Manhattans too spirit-forward.
