# History
The "Midnight Stinger" is a modern cocktail created by Sam Ross of Attaboy in New York City, New York. It is a contemporary twist on the classic "Stinger" cocktail.

The Midnight Stinger transforms the original Stinger into a Whiskey Sour by substituting whiskey for the traditional brandy and incorporating citrus juice, sugar, and the bitter amaro Fernet-Branca. It combines aspects of the King Cole cocktail (bourbon, Fernet, simple syrup) and the whiskey sour (bourbon, lemon juice, simple syrup).

For context, the original Stinger cocktail emerged around 1890 in the United States. It gained popularity as a "society" drink, particularly in New York City, and was initially consumed as a digestif, or after-dinner drink. Its popularity continued through Prohibition, as the crème de menthe in the drink could help mask the flavor of lower-quality brandies available at the time.

This particular recipe features Bourbon, Fernet Branca, Lemon Juice, and Simple Syrup, creating a complex and refreshing whiskey sour variation with a distinct bitter and herbal note from the Fernet Branca.
