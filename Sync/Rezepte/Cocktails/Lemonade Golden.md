# History
The "Lemonade Golden" cocktail is a modern and creative drink that combines elements of the classic "Fizz" cocktail family with the refreshing qualities of lemonade. While the "Golden" in its name is traditionally associated with the inclusion of an egg yolk, this recipe notably uses egg white, suggesting a unique interpretation.

**Fizz Cocktails:**
The Fizz is a category of mixed drinks that evolved from the older "sours" family of cocktails. Its defining characteristics are the inclusion of an acidic juice (typically lemon or lime) and carbonated water. Fizz cocktails became widely popular in America between 1900 and the 1940s, with New Orleans being a notable hub for their popularity. The "Silver Fizz" is a variation that includes egg white for a frothy texture.

**Lemonade:**
Lemonade is a sweetened, lemon-flavored beverage with a history spanning over a thousand years. Its fundamental ingredients—water, sugar, and lemon juice—have remained largely consistent. The term "lemonade" itself has roots in 16th-century French and Italiaccordingly.

This "Lemonade Golden" recipe features Lemon Juice, Egg White, Simple Syrup, and Soda Water. It is essentially a non-alcoholic or low-alcohol "Silver Fizz" with a lemonade base. The egg white provides a rich, frothy texture, while the lemon juice and simple syrup create a balanced sweet and tart profile, all lengthened with soda water for a refreshing effervescence. The "Golden" in its name, despite the use of egg white, likely refers to its vibrant appearance or its rich, luxurious texture.
