# History
The "Kir" cocktail, a classic French apéritif, has a rich history rooted in the Burgundy region of France.

The drink was originally known as "blanc-cassis" (white-cassis) before being renamed. Its modern name comes from Félix Kir (1876–1968), a Catholic priest, a hero of the French Resistance during World War II, and the mayor of Dijon from 1945 to 1968.

During the Nazi occupation, red wine, a staple of French culture, was confiscated. Faced with an abundance of local white wine, Félix Kir popularized the cocktail by combining the local Crème de Cassis (blackcurrant liqueur) with a local white wine, typically Aligoté. This not only made use of available local products but also created a drink whose color mimicked the confiscated red wines, serving as a subtle act of defiance and a symbol of local pride. Kir frequently served this drink at official receptions, promoting the region's products and further cementing his name with the cocktail.

The "Kir Royal" emerged later, after World War II, when French bartenders elevated the drink by substituting the white wine with champagne or another sparkling wine, maintaining the Crème de Cassis. This made the cocktail more sophisticated and suitable for celebrations.

This particular recipe, featuring Crème de Cassis and Champagne, is a classic rendition of the "Kir Royal," a more celebratory version of the traditional Kir.
