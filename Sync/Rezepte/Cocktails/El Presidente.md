# History
The "El Presidente" cocktail is a classic Cuban drink with a rich history, originating during the Prohibition era in the United States. Its creation is generally attributed to Cuba in the early 1900s, a time when American tourists flocked to the island for its vibrant cocktail scene due to alcohol prohibition in their home country.

The cocktail's name honors a Cuban president, though there are two primary figures associated with its origin:
*   **Mario García Menocal:** President of Cuba from 1913 to 1921. An article from the *New York Evening Telegram* in 1919 first accurately described the drink, suggesting it was named in his honor. Bacardi also supports this origin, claiming the drink was created in 1913 for Menocal and originally contained amber rum, sweet vermouth, and Angostura bitters.
*   **Gerardo Machado:** President in the 1920s. Another account suggests the cocktail was crafted by bartender Eddie Woelke at the Jockey Club in Havana and named after Machado.

The "El Presidente" typically consists of rum (historically, white or amber), grenadine, vermouth (often a semi-dry, white "blanc" vermouth like Vermouth de Chambery, as specified in early Cuban recipes), and orange liqueur (such as Curaçao). It gained significant popularity in Cuba and subsequently in the United States during and after Prohibition, with society correspondent Basil Woon even deeming it the "aristocrat of cocktails."

After a decline in popularity in the mid-20th century, the "El Presidente" experienced a resurgence in the 2000s, rediscovered and reinterpreted by modern bartenders and cocktail historians.
