# History
The "Mr. Brown cocktail" is a modern classic created in 2011 by bartender Ms. Franky Marshall at the Clover Club in New York City. This rich, copper-hued drink is described as a nightcap-style cocktail that tastes like a vanilla-infused Coffee Old Fashioned.

Its primary ingredients include bourbon, coffee liqueur, vanilla syrup, Angostura bitters, and orange bitters. The cocktail's flavor profile is characterized by complementary notes of bourbon, coffee, vanilla, and orange, with the coffee liqueur leading on aroma and palate, and vanilla syrup smoothing the edges.

The exact origin of the name "Mr. Brown" is unknown. It could be a nod to the cocktail's deep umber color or a reference to the minor character "Mr. Brown" played by Quentin Tarantino in his 1992 film *Reservoir Dogs*. The cocktail shares a similar flavor profile with Jon Santer's "Revolver," an early 2000s drink considered a Manhattan riff that substitutes coffee liqueur for vermouth.
