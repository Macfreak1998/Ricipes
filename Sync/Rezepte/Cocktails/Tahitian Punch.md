# History
The history of Tahitian Punch is intertwined with the broader evolution of rum punches in the Caribbean and the specific incorporation of local Tahitian flavors. The general concept of rum punch emerged in the 17th-century Caribbean, where sailors and colonists combined rum with citrus and spices.

In Tahiti, this tradition evolved to create what is known as Tahitian Rum Punch, a cocktail that embodies the island's vibrant culture and tropical bounty. It typically features golden rum, fresh lime juice, passion fruit juice, pineapple juice, orange liqueur, and a touch of grenadine. This blend reflects the abundance of fresh fruits found in Tahiti.

While not a direct "Tahitian Punch," the renowned Mai Tai cocktail has a significant connection to Tahitian culture. Created in California in 1944 by Victor Bergeron, also known as Trader Vic, the drink was named after the Tahitian phrase "Maita'i roa ae," meaning "out of this world - the best," uttered by Tahitian friends who tasted it.

This recipe, with Puerto Rican rum, lime juice, simple syrup, and passion fruit syrup, is a classic example of a Tahitian Punch, offering a refreshing and tropical blend of flavors.
