# History
The history of the Tom Collins cocktail is debated, with two primary theories regarding its origin.

One theory suggests the Tom Collins evolved from a drink called the John Collins. This cocktail is believed to have been created in the 1860s by John Collins, a headwaiter at Limmer's Old House in London. The original John Collins cocktail used Genever, a malty, juniper-based spirit from Holland. As English tastes shifted, Old Tom Gin began to be used, and the drink's name eventually changed to Tom Collins.

The second prominent theory links the cocktail to a widespread hoax in New York in 1874. The prank involved people telling others that a man named Tom Collins was spreading lies about them. Bartenders, inspired by this popular joke, began to invent and serve a cocktail named the "Tom Collins" to those who came in asking for the non-existent individual.

Regardless of its exact origin, the first recorded recipe for the Tom Collins appeared in the second edition of Jerry Thomas's "The Bartender's Guide," published in 1876. The traditional Tom Collins is a simple, refreshing mix of gin, lemon juice, sugar (or gum syrup), and soda water. This recipe, with gin, simple syrup, lemon juice, and soda water, is a classic example of this enduring and refreshing cocktail.
