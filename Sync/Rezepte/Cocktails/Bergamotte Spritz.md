# History
The Bergamotte Spritz is a modern variation of the classic Italian Spritz. The original Spritz was created in the 1800s in the Veneto region of Italy, when soldiers of the Austrian Empire would dilute the local wine with a "spritz" (spray) of water.

The modern Spritz, made with prosecco and a bitter liqueur, became popular in the 20th century. The Bergamotte Spritz is a recent twist on this classic, adding the unique flavor of bergamot, a fragrant citrus fruit. This is usually achieved through the use of a bergamot liqueur, such as Italicus Rosolio di Bergamotto.

Italicus was created by mixologist Giuseppe Gallo, who was inspired by historic Italian "rosolio" liqueurs. The addition of this bergamot liqueur gives the spritz a fresh, aromatic, and slightly floral character, making it a popular and refreshing aperitif.
