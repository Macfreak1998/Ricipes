# History
The Nookie is a modern coffee cocktail created by Instagram bartender @bad_birdy. The name and the bartender's description ("I don't think I've tried a better coffee flavored cocktail!") suggest this is a deeply personal favorite that impressed even its creator.

The cocktail represents an Irish twist on the Espresso Martini format, substituting Irish whiskey for the traditional vodka base. This substitution fundamentally changes the drink's character—where vodka provides a neutral canvas for coffee and liqueur, Irish whiskey adds its own flavor complexity: notes of vanilla, honey, and sometimes even a hint of coffee itself (depending on the whiskey).

**The Cream Float:**

What distinguishes The Nookie from a standard whiskey-espresso sour is the heavy cream float on top. This technique creates a visual layered effect and provides a rich, luxurious mouthfeel. As you drink, the cream mixes with the coffee-whiskey base, creating a flavor that evolves from creamy sweetness to bitter coffee intensity—similar to drinking an Irish Coffee but in cold cocktail form.

The dusting of coffee grounds on top adds aromatic complexity (fresh coffee grounds are intensely fragrant) and provides textural interest, mimicking the foam cap of an Espresso Martini but with a different technique.

**For Espresso Martini Lovers:**

Bad_birdy positions this explicitly for "Espresso Martini lovers, coffee lovers and enthusiasts," suggesting The Nookie offers something that even dedicated espresso martini fans will find exciting. The Irish whiskey base provides warmth and complexity that vodka cannot, while the cream float adds richness that a shaken foam doesn't provide.

The Nookie exemplifies modern cocktail culture's willingness to take beloved templates (in this case, coffee cocktails) and reimagine them with different spirits and techniques to create something familiar yet distinctly new.
