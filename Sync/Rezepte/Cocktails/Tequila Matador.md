# History
The history of the Tequila Matador cocktail is marked by two distinct recipes bearing the same name.

The earlier version of the Matador cocktail first appeared in the 1937 "Café Royal Cocktail Book." This rendition combined tequila, dry vermouth, and orange curaçao, offering an apéritif-style drink that some describe as a "Tequila Martini." This 1930s cocktail was likely one of the first tequila cocktails and would have been a novelty in London at the time.

A second, more widely known version, often referred to as the "Tequila Matador," was published in 1972 in "Trader Vic's Bartender's Guide." This tropical take on the cocktail typically features tequila, pineapple juice, and lime. It is considered a simple variation of the Margarita, with pineapple juice replacing other ingredients. While the inventor is not definitively known, the combination of popular Mexican exports (tequila, pineapple, and lime) suggests it could have originated in Mexico.

This recipe, with tequila blanco, lime juice, simple syrup, fresh mint, and triple sec, aligns with the spirit of the Trader Vic's version, offering a refreshing and fruity tequila-based cocktail. The addition of mint further enhances its tropical character.
