# History
The Vodka Sling is a modern adaptation of a much older cocktail known as the "Sling," which originated in colonial America around 1759. Initially, a Sling was a straightforward concoction of spirit, water, and sugar, sometimes garnished with nutmeg.

Over time, the drink evolved with the addition of lemon juice, transforming it into a more refreshing beverage. The concept of a "bittered sling" was documented as early as 1806 and is considered a precursor to cocktails like the Old Fashioned. Throughout the 19th century, various spirit-based Slings gained popularity, including the Gin Sling, Rum Sling, Brandy Sling, and Whisky Sling.

The Vodka Sling specifically emerged as a contemporary variation, capitalizing on vodka's neutral flavor and versatility, particularly as the spirit became a staple in bars globally during the late 20th century. It is essentially a modern interpretation of the classic 18th-century Sling, typically made with vodka, lemon juice, simple syrup, and soda water. This recipe, with lemon juice, simple syrup, vodka, soda water, and cherry brandy, is a classic example of this refreshing and adaptable cocktail.
