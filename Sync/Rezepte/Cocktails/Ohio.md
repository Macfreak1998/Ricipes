# History
The "Ohio" cocktail, also known as "The Ohio Cocktail," is a historical drink of German origin, dating back to the late 1890s. It is generally characterized as a spiritous drink, often containing brandy, whiskey, or white wine, and typically topped with champagne. Unlike many cocktails, it usually does not include citrus juice.

Recipes for this cocktail have varied over the decades, but a common adaptation involves cognac, vanilla liqueur or syrup, and white wine, stirred with ice, strained into a champagne saucer, filled with champagne, and garnished with a lemon twist and a cherry. MFK Fisher, in her writings, also mentioned an "Ohio" cocktail consumed on a German ship in 1935, describing it as sweet, made with brandy, gin, and cordials, and topped with champagne.

This particular recipe features Sweet Vermouth, Rye Whiskey, Triple Sec, Angostura Bitters, and Champagne. It is a variation that uses rye whiskey as its base, combined with sweet vermouth and triple sec, and topped with champagne, creating a sophisticated and celebratory drink.
