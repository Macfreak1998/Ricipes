# History
The "Pelican cocktail," as presented in this recipe, is a modern and creative drink that does not have a widely documented historical origin. The name "Pelican" likely refers to the large, fish-eating bird, perhaps evoking a sense of coastal or tropical refreshment.

This particular recipe features Lemon Juice, Grenadine, Lime Juice, and Grapefruit Juice. This combination creates a vibrant, fruity, and refreshing non-alcoholic or low-alcohol drink. The blend of lemon, lime, and grapefruit juices provides a tart and sweet citrus base, while grenadine adds a touch of sweetness and a beautiful reddish hue. It is a simple yet effective and refreshing beverage, perfect for cooling down on a warm day.
