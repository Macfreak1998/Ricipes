# History
The "James Bond" cocktail, as presented in this recipe, is a variation of the classic Champagne Cocktail, likely named to evoke the iconic character's association with sophisticated drinks and Champagne. While James Bond is most famously known for the Vesper Martini (a gin and vodka martini he created in Ian Fleming's *Casino Royale*), he is also strongly associated with Champagne.

The **Champagne Cocktail** is a classic sparkling drink with a rich history, originating in the mid-19th century. The first published recipe for this cocktail appeared in Jerry Thomas's influential *Bartender's Guide* in 1862. This cocktail quickly became a symbol of luxury and was favored by the aristocracy, embodying elegance and timeless appeal. It typically consists of a sugar cube, Angostura bitters, Champagne, and often brandy, garnished with a maraschino cherry or a twist of lemon peel.

This "James Bond" cocktail takes the classic Champagne Cocktail and substitutes vodka for the traditional brandy. It features a Sugar Cube, Angostura Bitters, Vodka, and Champagne. This creates a crisp, effervescent, and slightly bitter-sweet drink, offering a modern and potent twist on the classic Champagne Cocktail, fitting for a character known for his strong and stylish preferences.
