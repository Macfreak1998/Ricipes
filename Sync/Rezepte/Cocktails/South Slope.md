# History

The "South Slope" cocktail was created in 2007 by Michael Madrusan, a notable bartender and owner of The Everleigh in Melbourne, Australia. Madrusan named the cocktail after the South Slope area of Brooklyn, where he resided at the time.



The South Slope cocktail is a gin-based aperitif. Its recipe typically includes gin, Aperol, Lillet Blanc, orange curaçao (or Dry Curaçao), and lemon juice. It has been described as reminiscent of an "Unusual Negroni Sour" due to the addition of orange liqueur and lemon juice. The cocktail gained further recognition when it was featured in Jim Meehan's 2011 "The PDT Cocktail Book."



This recipe, with gin, Aperol, Lillet Blanc, Dry Curaçao, and lemon juice, aligns with Madrusan's original creation, offering a balanced and sophisticated drink that combines bitter, sweet, and sour notes with a refreshing gin base.
