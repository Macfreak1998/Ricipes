# History
The 2-2 is a modern craft cocktail created by Instagram bartender @she_thebartender, designed for those who appreciate complex, bitter flavors. The bartender's introduction—"Rarely do you find someone who loves absinthe but hates aperol. ITS MY OPINION. But when I made this for that exact person, they loved it"—reveals this cocktail's purpose: converting Aperol skeptics through the addition of absinthe.

**The Bitter Balance:**

The name "2-2" likely refers to the equal-parts formula approach, though the recipe itself uses ratios rather than equal parts. What makes this cocktail distinctive is the bold combination of two intensely flavored ingredients:

**Aperol** (1.5 oz): The Italian bitter aperitif with orange, rhubarb, and gentian root flavors. Lower in alcohol (11%) and sweeter than Campari, but still distinctly bitter.

**Absinthe** (1 oz): The high-proof spirit with pronounced anise/licorice character and herbal complexity from wormwood, fennel, and other botanicals.

Most bartenders use absinthe sparingly—a rinse or a few drops. This recipe uses a full ounce, making absinthe a co-star rather than a supporting player. This bold approach creates a drink with serious herbal intensity.

**The Orange Amplification:**

Six dashes of orange bitters plus a flamed orange peel create an orange-forward profile that ties Aperol and absinthe together. Flaming the peel caramelizes the essential oils, adding a slightly burnt, complex citrus aroma that complements both the bitter and herbal elements.

**For Aperol Haters:**

The bartender's anecdote is telling: this drink converted someone who "loves absinthe but hates aperol." The absinthe's intensity and herbal character apparently reframe Aperol's bitterness in a new context, making it more palatable to those who find Aperol too sweet or one-dimensional on its own.

The 2-2 represents modern mixology's willingness to use bold, challenging flavors in substantial quantities, trusting that the right combination can make even divisive ingredients shine.
