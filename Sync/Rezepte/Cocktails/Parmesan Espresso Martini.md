# History
The Parmesan Espresso Martini is one of the most viral cocktail sensations to emerge from TikTok in 2023, amassing over 328 million views under the hashtag #parmesanespressomartini. This audacious variation on the classic Espresso Martini divided the internet into passionate camps of believers and skeptics.

The drink's origins trace back to contemporary cocktail culture's obsession with unexpected flavor combinations and the "umami trend" that swept through fine dining and mixology in the early 2020s. The combination gained massive traction when bartenders and home mixologists began posting videos on TikTok, particularly @highproofpreacher's viral video, showing the dramatic reveal: a classic espresso martini topped with a generous blanket of freshly grated Parmigiano Reggiano cheese.

**The Controversy:**

The cocktail sparked intense debate in the cocktail community. Skeptics called it a "textural nightmare" and questioned whether cheese belonged in cocktails at all. Proponents argued that the salty, umami-rich Parmesan perfectly complements coffee's bitter notes, similar to how salt enhances caramel or chocolate.

**The Science:**

The pairing actually makes sense from a flavor perspective. High-quality Parmigiano Reggiano contains glutamates (the source of umami) that can enhance and round out coffee's natural flavors. The cheese's saltiness works similarly to a pinch of salt in coffee—bringing out complexity and reducing bitterness. The fat in the cheese also creates a rich mouthfeel that complements the coffee liqueur's sweetness.

**Critical Details:**

Using freshly grated Parmigiano Reggiano is absolutely essential—pre-shredded cheese contains anti-caking agents that create an unpleasant texture and flavor. The cheese should be grated extremely fine, almost into a powder, creating a delicate "snow" on top of the foam rather than chunky bits. Quality matters immensely: authentic Parmigiano Reggiano's complex, nutty, slightly fruity flavor profile works far better than generic parmesan.

**Reception:**

Wine Enthusiast and other major cocktail publications tested the drink, with mixed but generally positive reviews. Many noted that while it sounds bizarre, the execution is surprisingly sophisticated when done correctly. The drink represents Gen Z's willingness to experiment with traditionally "weird" flavor combinations and challenge cocktail orthodoxy.

**Cultural Impact:**

The Parmesan Espresso Martini became emblematic of TikTok's influence on cocktail culture in the 2020s, where viral trends could make or break drinks overnight. It demonstrated that social media-driven cocktails could be more than just pretty colors—they could genuinely push flavor boundaries and spark legitimate culinary conversations.

Whether you love it or hate it, the Parmesan Espresso Martini represents modern cocktail culture's adventurous spirit and willingness to question every assumption about what belongs in a glass.

**Pro tip:** If you're skeptical, start with a very light dusting of cheese. You can always add more, but you can't remove it once it's there.
