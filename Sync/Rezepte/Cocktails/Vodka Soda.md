# History
The Vodka Soda, a seemingly simple two-ingredient cocktail, has a history rooted in the broader practice of mixing spirits with other liquids to make them more palatable. This tradition dates back centuries, with examples like sailors mixing rum with lime and sugar to prevent scurvy.

The crucial element for the Vodka Soda, carbonated water, has its origins in 1783 Geneva, Switzerland, when scientist Johann Jacob Schweppe developed a method to bottle carbonated mineral water. Schweppe's company went on to produce various carbonated products, paving the way for the widespread availability of soda water.

While many spirits are mixed with club soda, the Vodka Soda gained significant popularity due to its simplicity, refreshing nature, and perceived health benefits (being low in sugar and calories). It became a mainstay in dance clubs, house parties, and bars worldwide for many decades. The drink's appeal lies in its clean, crisp taste and its ability to provide a "kick" without the intense flavors or added sugar of many other cocktails.

Vodka itself has a long history, originating in Eastern Europe in the 8th or 9th century. The mid-20th century saw the rise of iconic vodka cocktails like the Moscow Mule and Bloody Mary, further solidifying vodka's place in mixology. The Vodka Soda continues to be one of the most commonly ordered drinks, valued for its straightforwardness and versatility. This recipe, with vodka, soda water, and lemon juice, is a classic example of this simple and refreshing cocktail.
