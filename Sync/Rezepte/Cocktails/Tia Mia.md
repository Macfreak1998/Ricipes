# History
The Tia Mia cocktail was created around 2010 by bartender Ivy Mix. She developed the drink for the Lani Kai, a Hawaiian-themed restaurant and bar in New York City, which was opened by influential bartender and business owner Julie Reiner.

The Tia Mia is a variation of the classic Mai Tai, with Mix initially experimenting with floating mezcal on top before incorporating it directly into the cocktail. It substitutes mezcal for the Martinique rum found in some Mai Tai iterations, earning it the nickname "Mexican Mai Tai." The name "Tia Mia" means "my aunt" in Spanish and was a fond nickname Mix used for one of her regular customers.

The cocktail gained popularity and was a staple on the menu at Leyenda, a James Beard Award-nominated Brooklyn bar co-owned by Reiner and Mix that specialized in agave spirits. The Tia Mia is also featured in Ivy Mix's book, "Spirits of Latin America." This recipe, with mezcal, Jamaican rum, dry curaçao, lime juice, and orgeat, is a classic example of this modern and innovative cocktail.
