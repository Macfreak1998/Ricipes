# History
The Stinger cocktail, traditionally made with brandy (often Cognac) and crème de menthe, originated around the 1890s in the United States. It likely evolved from a cocktail called "The Judge," which appeared in William Schmidt's 1892 cocktail book "The Flowing Bowl." The name "Stinger" was officially adopted in Jacques Straub's "Straub's Manual of Mixed Drinks" in 1913.

Initially, the Stinger was considered a digestif, an after-dinner drink, and was particularly popular among high society. Millionaire Reginald Vanderbilt is often credited with popularizing the drink. Its popularity continued through the Prohibition era, partly because the crème de menthe could mask the taste of lower-quality brandies.

While the classic Stinger uses brandy, the "Rum Stinger" is a variation where rum replaces the brandy. This version offers a different flavor profile, often with a lighter or more tropical character, while retaining the refreshing minty notes from the crème de menthe. This recipe, with white rum and crème de menthe white, is a straightforward and refreshing interpretation of this classic after-dinner cocktail.
