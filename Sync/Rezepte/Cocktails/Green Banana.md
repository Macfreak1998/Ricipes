# History
The "Green Banana" cocktail is primarily characterized by its use of green banana liqueur, a spirit made from unripe bananas. This liqueur has a distinctive green color and a flavor profile that is both sweet and slightly tart, with subtle banana notes.

The origins of green banana liqueur can be traced back to the Caribbean islands, where unripe bananas are abundant. It was first produced in the French Caribbean island of Guadeloupe in the 19th century. The liqueur quickly gained popularity in other Caribbean islands and Latin American countries, where it continues to be primarily produced and used in local cuisine and culture.

In the context of cocktails, "Green Banana" refers to the specific green banana liqueur, which is distinct from liqueurs made from ripe, yellow bananas. The "green" signifies both the color of the liqueur and the use of unripe bananas in its production, contributing to its unique sweet and tart taste profile.
