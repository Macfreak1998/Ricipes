# History
The "Ante Up" cocktail is a modern creation by bartender Nicholas Jarrett. Specific details regarding the exact inspiration or circumstances of its creation are not widely documented.

The name "Ante Up" is an idiom that originates from poker and other betting games. To "ante up" signifies making a bet or contributing to the pot before the cards are dealt. More broadly, it means to pay what is due, contribute, or do one's share, and by extension, to increase the stakes, risk, or effort in a situation. While the general meaning of the phrase is clear, Nicholas Jarrett's specific reasoning for naming this particular cocktail "Ante Up" is not detailed in the available information.
