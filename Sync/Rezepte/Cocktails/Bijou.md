# History
The "Bijou" cocktail, whose name means "jewel" in French, was created by Harry Johnson, often referred to as "the father of professional bartending." Johnson named it "Bijou" because he saw a gem in each of its main ingredients: gin represented diamonds for its clarity, the red hue of sweet vermouth symbolized rubies, and Chartreuse played the role of emeralds with its vibrant green color.

The cocktail first appeared in the late 1800s, with its recipe dating back to the 1890s and being comprehensively documented in Johnson's 1900 "New and Improved Bartender Manual." The original recipe typically called for equal parts gin, sweet vermouth, and green Chartreuse, along with a dash of orange bitters.

While the Bijou was popular for several decades, it faded into obscurity during the Prohibition era. It was rediscovered in the 1980s by Dale DeGroff, "the King of Cocktails," who modified the original equal-parts recipe by tripling the ratio of gin to vermouth and Chartreuse to soften the taste profile, a version that eventually became the modern standard.
