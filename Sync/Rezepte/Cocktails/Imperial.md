# History
The "Imperial Cocktail" is a classic, Martini-style drink with a history dating back to the early 20th century. Recipes for this cocktail can be found in "Daly's Bartender's Encyclopedia" from 1903 and Hugo Ensslin's 1917 cocktail compendium.

This rendition is essentially a variation of a 50:50 Martini, made with gin, French (dry) vermouth, a dash of maraschino liqueur, and a dash of aromatic bitters. It was often garnished with an olive and was noted as being popular among Europeans, especially the French, who had a fondness for cordials.

The name "Imperial" likely evokes a sense of grandeur, sophistication, and European elegance, reflecting the cocktail's refined ingredients and its popularity in high society during its era. This particular recipe features Dry Vermouth, Gin, Maraschino Liqueur, and Lemon Zest, creating a crisp, aromatic, and subtly sweet Martini variation.
