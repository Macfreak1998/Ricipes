# History
The Velvet Hammer cocktail is believed to have originated in the late 1960s, 1970s, or early 1980s, a period when creamy, liqueur-based drinks were particularly fashionable.

The name "Velvet Hammer" aptly describes the drink's characteristics: it is "soft as velvet" due to its creamy texture, yet it "packs a punch" like a hammer because of its alcohol content.

While recipes can vary, the cocktail typically includes an orange liqueur (such as Cointreau or Triple Sec), crème de cacao, and cream. Other common additions include cognac, vodka, or a coffee liqueur. The Velvet Hammer became a popular choice during the disco era and is often enjoyed as a dessert cocktail due to its rich, sweet, and creamy profile. This recipe, with heavy cream, crème de cacao white, and vodka, is a classic example of this indulgent and popular cocktail.
