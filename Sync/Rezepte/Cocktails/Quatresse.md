# History
The "Quatresse" is the signature cocktail of Combat bar in Paris, created by its owner, Margot Lecarpentier. The bar's name is derived from its location next to the Quartier du Combat, an area historically known for animal fights, and also reflects Lecarpentier's personal struggles to secure a business loaccordingly.

The name "Quatresse" itself signifies the four key ingredients in the cocktail that begin with the letter "S": sage, single-malt scotch, simple syrup, and Salers or Suze (a gentian-based liqueur).

The cocktail gained wider recognition around July 2020, notably through its inclusion in David Lebovitz's book "Drinking French".
