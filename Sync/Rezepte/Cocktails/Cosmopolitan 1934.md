# History
The "Cosmopolitan" cocktail has a history that dates back further than its popularization in the late 20th century. While the modern, vodka-based version gained fame in the 1980s and 1990s, particularly through its appearance on "Sex and the City," an earlier iteration of a "Cosmopolitan Cocktail" or "Cosmopolitan Daisy" appeared in a 1934 cocktail book titled "Pioneers of Mixing at Elite Bars 1903–1933."

The 1934 version of the Cosmopolitan was significantly different from its contemporary counterpart. Its ingredients typically included gin (often Gordon's gin), Cointreau or triple sec, lemon juice, and raspberry syrup. This earlier recipe is described as a gin sour with a subtle raspberry fruitiness. The raspberry syrup was responsible for giving the drink its characteristic pink hue, in contrast to the cranberry juice used in the modern recipe. This 1934 rendition is often considered a "Gin Daisy" cocktail and a more "well-balanced version" than what is frequently served today.

The meaning or significance of the 1934 Cosmopolitan is rooted in the cocktail culture of that era, where gin was a popular spirit. It represents an earlier style of cocktail mixing, distinct from the vodka-centric trends that emerged later in the century.
