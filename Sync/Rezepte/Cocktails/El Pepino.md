# History
The "El Pepino" cocktail, whose name means "the cucumber" in Spanish, is a refreshing, often spicy, twist on the classic Margarita. It gained significant mainstream popularity in 2012 when Justin Timberlake mentioned it as his favorite cocktail.

The exact origin of the "El Pepino" cocktail is "steeped in legend and mystery," with no single person definitively credited with its invention. Several stories and claims exist, including one that suggests it was created by a bartender in Mexico City looking to use extra cucumbers, or by American expatriates living in Mexico. Noted bar professional Junior Merino is associated with a version that includes pineapple, and Las Vegas mixologist Gaston Martinez is credited with a version that features cilantro and egg white. Despite these specific claims, the truth is likely more "mundane," as it's difficult to pinpoint the very first person to muddle cucumber into a Margarita. Its rise to prominence was significantly boosted by Justin Timberlake's endorsement in 2012.

The name "El Pepino" simply means "the cucumber" in Spanish, directly referencing its key ingredient. Beyond the literal translation, the cocktail represents a refreshing and versatile adaptation of the classic Margarita, allowing for various creative interpretations by bartenders and home enthusiasts alike.
