# History
The "Paloma" cocktail, a popular drink in Mexico, derives its name from the Spanish word "Paloma," meaning "the dove." This name is often attributed to a popular Mexican folk song from the 1860s, "La Paloma," or sometimes to the drink's whitish color.

The exact origin of the Paloma is not definitively known, but it is widely believed to have originated in Mexico around the 1950s. Before the Paloma, Mexicans were already mixing tequila with various carbonated sodas, a combination they called "changuirongo," in the 1940s. A significant development in the Paloma's history was the introduction of Squirt, a grapefruit soda, to Mexico in 1955. This is thought to be when the specific combination of tequila and grapefruit soda, characteristic of the Paloma, first came together.

For many years, Don Javier Delgado Corona, the owner of La Capilla bar in Tequila, Jalisco, was credited with inventing the Paloma. However, he denied creating the drink, though he is known for inventing another popular cocktail, the Batanga. The Paloma's popularity surged in the mid-1990s, first within Mexico and then internationally, becoming recognized as the national drink of Mexico.

Traditionally, a Paloma is made with tequila, grapefruit soda, lime juice, and often a pinch of salt. This particular recipe features Blanco Tequila, fresh lime juice, a pinch of salt, and grapefruit soda, creating a refreshing and balanced drink.
