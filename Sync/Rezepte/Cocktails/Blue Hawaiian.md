# History
The "Blue Hawaiian" cocktail is often confused with the "Blue Hawaii," its predecessor, due to their similar names and blue color. While both are tropical drinks, they have distinct origins and ingredients.

The **Blue Hawaii** cocktail was invented in 1957 by Harry Yee, the head bartender at the Hilton Hawaiian Village in Waikiki, Hawaii. Yee created the drink at the request of a Bols liquor sales representative who wanted a cocktail featuring their blue Curaçao liqueur. The original Blue Hawaii typically contains rum, vodka, blue Curaçao, pineapple juice, and sweet and sour mix. Yee named the drink after the title song from the 1937 Bing Crosby film "Waikiki Wedding."

The **Blue Hawaiian** cocktail is a variation of the Blue Hawaii. Its exact origin is less clear, with some suggestions pointing to the 1960s or even Don the Beachcomber, a pioneer of tiki culture. The key difference in the Blue Hawaiian is the inclusion of cream of coconut, which replaces the sweet and sour mix found in the Blue Hawaii. This substitution gives the Blue Hawaiian a creamier texture and a taste profile closer to a Piña Colada, often resulting in a lighter aquamarine hue. Its ingredients typically include light rum, blue Curaçao, pineapple juice, cream of coconut, and lemon juice, sometimes omitting vodka.
