# History
The "Love & Murder" cocktail is a modern drink created by bartender Nick Bennett at Porchlight in New York City in 2021.

The cocktail was conceived by Nick Bennett, who aimed to create a modern classic using two often polarizing liqueurs: Campari and Green Chartreuse. These two ingredients, known for their strong and distinctive flavors, are typically used in supporting roles in cocktails, making their equal-part presence as the base of the "Love & Murder" unique.

The name "Love & Murder" is a direct reference to the Broadway play "A Gentleman's Guide to Love and Murder." Bennett, knowing that Broadway actors frequented Porchlight, chose the name as an enjoyable nod to the theater community. While some might interpret the name as a reflection of the contrasting flavors of Campari (bitter) and Green Chartreuse (herbaceous and boozy), or the idea that people either love one liqueur and hate the other, Bennett confirmed the theatrical inspiration.

The cocktail typically includes Campari, Green Chartreuse, Lime Juice, Simple Syrup, and Saline Solution (or a pinch of salt). The saline solution is considered an essential component for balancing the cocktail's flavors. This particular recipe features Campari, Green Chartreuse, Lime Juice, Simple Syrup, and Saline Solution, creating a complex and balanced drink with a unique interplay of bitter, herbaceous, and citrus notes.
