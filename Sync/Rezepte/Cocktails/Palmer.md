# History
The "Palmer" cocktail, as presented in this recipe, is a modern and creative alcoholic drink that does not have a widely documented historical origin. The name "Palmer" most commonly refers to the non-alcoholic "Arnold Palmer" drink, a popular blend of iced tea and lemonade, named after the legendary golfer Arnold Palmer.

This particular recipe features Bourbon, Angostura Bitters, and Lemon. It is a whiskey-based drink that takes inspiration from the simplicity and refreshing qualities often associated with the Arnold Palmer, but transforms it into an alcoholic cocktail. The bourbon provides a robust base, while the lemon adds a tart citrus note, and Angostura bitters contribute a complex aromatic spice. It is a straightforward and flavorful drink, offering a sophisticated blend of whiskey and citrus, perhaps designed as a tribute to the golfer's refined taste.
