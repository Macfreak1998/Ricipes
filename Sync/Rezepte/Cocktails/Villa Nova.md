# History
The "Villa Nova" cocktail is a modern creation, with its recipe published by "The Educated Barfly." Its publication date of October 2, 2025, suggests it is a contemporary drink, possibly an "Original Cocktail" developed by "The Educated Barfly" or a modern bartender.

The name "Villa Nova" itself, meaning "new house" or "new town" in Italian, appears in various contexts:
*   **Restaurants:** Notable Italian restaurants named "Villa Nova" existed in Florida and Los Angeles.
*   **Historical Figure:** Arnaldus de Villa Nova (1240–1311) was a physician and alchemist who pioneered the medicinal use of distilled alcohol.
*   **Geographical Location:** Vila Nova de Gaia in Portugal is renowned for its port wine lodges.

While these historical and geographical references share the "Villa Nova" name, there is no direct evidence linking them to the creation or specific meaning of this cocktail recipe.
