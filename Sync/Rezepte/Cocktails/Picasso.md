# History
The "Picasso" cocktail, as presented in this recipe, is a modern and creative drink that does not have a widely documented historical origin. The name "Picasso" is a clear homage to the renowned artist Pablo Picasso, often used in cocktails to evoke a sense of artistry, creativity, or a unique blend of flavors.

While there are other cocktails named "Picasso," such as the "Picasso Martini" (a cubist take on a classic Martini) or a version with cognac, Dubonnet, and lime juice, this recipe offers a distinct interpretation.

This particular recipe features Lemon Juice, Sweet Vermouth, and Brandy. This combination creates a balanced and sophisticated drink, blending the rich warmth of brandy with the herbal sweetness of sweet vermouth and the tartness of lemon juice. It is a spirit-forward cocktail that offers a complex and intriguing flavor profile, perhaps reflecting the multifaceted nature of Picasso's art.
