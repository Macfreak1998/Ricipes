# History
The name "Red Snapper" typically refers to a gin-based variation of the classic Bloody Mary cocktail. This traditional Red Snapper is made with gin, tomato juice, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, Tabasco, and various spices. It was created at the St. Regis Hotel in New York in the 1930s as a more "proper" alternative to the Bloody Mary, especially when vodka was scarce or the name was deemed too vulgar.

However, the cocktail described in this recipe, with ingredients like heavy cream, grenadine, Galliano, and white rum, is a completely different drink and does not align with the historical "Red Snapper." This suggests that this recipe is either a unique creation, a very obscure local variation, or potentially a misnamed cocktail.

Given its ingredients, this "Red Snapper" is a sweet, creamy, and fruity dessert-style drink, with no known historical connection to the savory, gin-based tomato juice cocktail. Its origins are likely modern and specific to the creator or establishment where it was developed.
