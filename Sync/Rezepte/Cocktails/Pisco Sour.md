# History
The Pisco Sour is a renowned alcoholic cocktail of Peruvian origin, considered a national drink in Peru. Its creation is widely credited to Victor Vaughen Morris, an American bartender who moved to Peru in 1903 and opened Morris' Bar in Lima in 1916. His initial creation was likely a simpler blend of pisco, lime juice, and sugar, similar to a whiskey sour.

The modern Peruvian Pisco Sour, which includes Angostura bitters and egg white, is attributed to Mario Bruiget, a Peruvian bartender who worked at Morris' Bar. He developed this version in the latter part of the 1920s. The base spirit, pisco, is a grape distillate produced in the Peruvian coastal valleys since the colonial era.

While there are some debates about its exact origins, Peru officially declared the Pisco Sour as part of its Cultural Heritage in 2007, and celebrates National Pisco Sour Day on the first Saturday of February. A Chilean version of the cocktail also exists, typically omitting the bitters and egg white.
