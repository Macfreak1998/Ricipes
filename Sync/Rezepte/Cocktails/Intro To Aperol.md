# History
The "Intro To Aperol" cocktail is a modern creation, likely designed to introduce drinkers to the unique flavor profile of Aperol, an iconic Italian bitter aperitif. While there isn't a specific historical origin or creator widely documented for a cocktail explicitly named "Intro To Aperol," its existence is a testament to Aperol's versatility and growing popularity in contemporary mixology.

Aperol was created in 1919 by brothers Luigi and Silvio Barbieri in Padua, Italy, making its debut at the Padova World Fair. The name "Aperol" is a nod to the French word "apéritif," referring to a drink consumed before a meal to stimulate the appetite. Aperol is distinguished by its bright orange hue and a bittersweet orange flavor, with a recipe that includes botanical ingredients such as gentian, rhubarb, and cinchona. While it gained some traction after World War II, the Aperol Spritz cocktail, made with Aperol, Prosecco, and soda water, rose to prominence in the 1950s. Today, Aperol is widely recognized as a symbol of Italian social culture and the "dolce vita" lifestyle.

This "Intro To Aperol" cocktail, featuring Aperol, Gin, Simple Syrup, Lemon Juice, and Angostura Bitters, is a balanced and refreshing drink. It showcases Aperol's bittersweet notes, complemented by the botanical complexity of gin, the tartness of lemon, and a touch of sweetness from simple syrup, with bitters adding depth. It serves as an excellent entry point for those new to Aperol, highlighting its ability to blend harmoniously with other spirits and flavors.
