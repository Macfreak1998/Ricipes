# History
The "Golden Nail" cocktail is a name applied to various drinks, with one notable version being a variation of the classic "Rusty Nail" cocktail, created by Drambuie brand ambassador Anthony Caporale. This version typically includes Drambuie Scotch Liqueur, Scotch Whisky, St. Germain elderflower liqueur, and lemon juice.

This particular recipe, featuring Bourbon and Southern Comfort, is a unique interpretation of a "Golden Nail" cocktail. It deviates significantly from the "Rusty Nail" variation. Instead, it combines the robust character of Bourbon with the sweet, fruity, and spicy notes of Southern Comfort. The name "Golden Nail" in this context likely refers to the golden hue of the bourbon and Southern Comfort, and perhaps alludes to a potent yet smooth drink, reminiscent of a "nail" in its strength. This simple, two-ingredient cocktail offers a warm and inviting flavor profile, perfect for sipping.
