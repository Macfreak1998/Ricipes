# History
There is no widely recognized cocktail specifically named "Au Revoir MH" with a definitively documented history or origin. This cocktail, featuring Gin, White Rum, Vodka, Blanco Tequila, Cherry Brandy, Lemon Juice, Simple Syrup, and topped with Wildberry, is likely a unique creation, a localized name, or a personal recipe.

The phrase "Au revoir" is French, meaning "good-bye for now" or literally "to the seeing again." It originated in the 1690s. The "MH" in the cocktail's name might refer to an individual, a place, or a specific event, but its meaning is not publicly documented. The cocktail's composition suggests a potent, multi-spirit drink, similar in style to a Long Island Iced Tea, with a fruity and sweet profile.
