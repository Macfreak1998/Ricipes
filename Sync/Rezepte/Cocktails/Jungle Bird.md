# History
The "Jungle Bird" cocktail originated on July 6, 1973, at the Aviary Bar in the Hilton Hotel in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. It was created by Jeffrey Ong Swee Teik, the beverage manager at the time, as a welcome drink for hotel guests.

The cocktail's name was inspired by the colorful tropical birds housed in a caged area that was visible from the bar. Fittingly, the drink was initially served in a distinctive bird-shaped ceramic vessel.

The original Jungle Bird recipe features a blend of dark rum, Campari, fresh lime juice, simple syrup (or demerara syrup), and pineapple juice. Its unique inclusion of Campari, an Italian bitter, sets it apart from many other tropical or tiki drinks, allowing it to appeal to both tiki enthusiasts and the broader craft cocktail community.

The cocktail gained international recognition after its inclusion in John J. Poister's 1989 publication, *The New American Bartender's Guide*. Its popularity was further cemented by American mixologist Jeff "Beachbum" Berry, who featured it in his 2002 book *Intoxica!*, suggesting dark Jamaican rum for the recipe. A significant evolution occurred in 2010 when bartender Giuseppe González, at New York City's Painkiller bar, refined the recipe by using blackstrap rum and reducing the pineapple juice, which enhanced the bitter notes of the Campari. The Jungle Bird has been recognized as an official cocktail by the International Bartenders Association since 2024.
