# History
The "East 8 Hold Up" cocktail was created in 2010 by bartender Kevin Armstrong at Milk & Honey in London.

The name of the cocktail is a reference to the E8 area of London, where Armstrong lived, which was known for frequent muggings. The specific inspiration for the name comes from a humorous incident involving Armstrong's friend, Sam Jeveons. One night, after being dropped off in a taxi in the E8 area, Jeveons stopped to relieve himself. While his trousers were down, a mugger approached him, stepped on his dropped trousers, and demanded his wallet. Jeveons reportedly chased the would-be mugger with his trousers still around his ankles. This "premium funny" event became known as the "East 8 Hold Up," lending its name to the cocktail.
