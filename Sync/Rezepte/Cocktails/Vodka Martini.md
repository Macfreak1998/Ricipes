# History

The Vodka Martini, a classic cocktail made with vodka and vermouth, has a rich and evolving history, stemming from the original gin-based Martini.



The origins of the classic Martini are debated, with theories suggesting its creation in the late 19th century. The original Martini typically featured gin, vermouth, and bitters.



Vodka's entry into Western cocktail culture in the mid-20th century, largely driven by brands like Smirnoff and Stolichnaya, paved the way for the Vodka Martini. In post-war America (1940s-1950s), vodka's neutral profile appealed to those seeking a smoother drink, leading bartenders to substitute vodka for gin in the classic Martini recipe. This new iteration was sometimes referred to as a "Kangaroo Cocktail" in the 1930s. The first documented reference to a Vodka Martini in a U.S. cocktail recipe book appeared in Ted Saucier's "Bottoms Up" in 1952.



The Vodka Martini's iconic status was significantly cemented by Ian Fleming's James Bond. While Bond initially ordered a "Vesper" (gin, vodka, and Kina Lillet), he later became known for drinking Vodka Martinis, a trend that continued with the film adaptations. This recipe, with vodka, dry vermouth, and orange bitters, is a classic example of this iconic cocktail.
