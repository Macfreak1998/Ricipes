# History
The "Derby" cocktail is a name associated with several distinct drinks, often evoking a sense of classic elegance or a connection to horse racing events. This particular recipe, featuring Gin and Peychaud's Bitters, is a simpler interpretation of an older "Derby cocktail."

An older version of a "Derby cocktail" was first recorded by Harry McElhone in 1927 and later appeared in the 1930 *Savoy Cocktail Book*. This historical version typically included gin, peach bitters, and mint leaves. The exact origin of this particular "Derby" is largely unknown or "completely lost in time."

The "Derby" cocktail in this recipe is a straightforward, spirit-forward drink that highlights the botanical notes of gin with the aromatic complexity of Peychaud's Bitters. It offers a crisp and clean profile, making it a sophisticated choice for those who appreciate classic gin cocktails.
