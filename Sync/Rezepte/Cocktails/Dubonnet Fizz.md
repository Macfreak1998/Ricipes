# History
The "Dubonnet Fizz" is a cocktail that combines Dubonnet, a French aromatized wine, with the effervescence of a "fizz" style drink. It emerged in the 1930s and was marketed as "the great French appetizer."

**Dubonnet History and Meaning:**
Dubonnet was first created in 1846 by Joseph Dubonnet, a Parisian chemist and wine merchant. Its original purpose was to make quinine, a bitter anti-malarial treatment, more palatable for French soldiers stationed in North Africa. Dubonnet achieved this by mixing quinine with a secret blend of herbs, spices, and wine. The resulting fortified red wine has a sweet, fruity, and slightly bitter taste. Dubonnet gained cultural significance as a popular aperitif and is famously associated with the British Royal Family, particularly Queen Elizabeth II.

**"Fizz Cocktail" History and Meaning:**
A "fizz cocktail" is a style of mixed drink that is a variation of the older "sours" family of cocktails. Its defining characteristics are the inclusion of an acidic juice, such as lemon or lime, and carbonated water. Fizzes typically feature a spirit like gin or rum. The history of the fizz cocktail was first documented in the 1887 edition of Jerry Thomas' Bartender's Guide. It became widely popular in the United States between 1900 and the 1940s, particularly in New Orleans.

The "Dubonnet Fizz" combines these elements, featuring Dubonnet, lemon juice, powdered sugar, orange juice, and soda water. This creates a refreshing and slightly bitter-sweet drink, perfect as an aperitif.
