# History
Nice & Toasty is a modern craft cocktail created by bartender @holycityhandcraft, featured by @theeducatedbarfly (Leandro DiMonriva) as part of his holiday cocktail series. The Educated Barfly specifically highlighted this cocktail: "Today we explore a cocktail from @holycityhandcraft this one was a drink that I knew I had to try when I saw it pop up on his feed. And perfect for the upcoming holiday if you're into that sort of thing."

**The Name:**

"Nice & Toasty" evokes warmth and comfort—perfect for winter and holiday drinking. The name suggests cozy evenings by the fire, holiday gatherings, and the warming qualities of the spirit-forward drink. The "toasty" reference also hints at the flamed grapefruit garnish technique.

**Holy City Handcraft:**

The creator represents Charleston, South Carolina's craft cocktail scene ("Holy City" is Charleston's nickname). Charleston has emerged as a Southern cocktail destination, known for innovative drinks that blend Southern hospitality with modern technique.

**Flavor Architecture:**

The drink combines three distinct elements:

- **Tequila Blanco** (1.5 oz): Earthy agave base with vegetal notes
- **Cocchi Americano** (1 oz): Italian aperitif wine with quinine, gentian, and citrus notes (a modern substitute for the discontinued Kina Lillet)
- **Bénédictine** (0.5 oz): French herbal liqueur with honey, herbs, and spice
- **Grapefruit Bitters** (8 dashes): Significant amount adds citrus bitterness and aromatic complexity

**The Cocchi Americano Choice:**

Cocchi Americano is a white wine-based aperitif that's become a craft cocktail staple. It's less bitter than vermouth, slightly sweeter, and has distinctive quinine character. Its wine base pairs beautifully with tequila's earthiness, creating a lighter, more refreshing profile than vermouth-based drinks.

**Flaming the Grapefruit:**

The flamed grapefruit twist isn't just theatrical—it caramelizes the essential oils in the peel, creating a slightly burnt, complex citrus aroma that changes the drink's character. This technique became popular in craft cocktail bars in the 2010s as bartenders explored ways to add aromatic complexity.

**Holiday Positioning:**

The Educated Barfly's mention of "perfect for the upcoming holiday" suggests this was shared around Thanksgiving or Christmas. Despite having bright citrus elements, the herbal complexity from Bénédictine and Cocchi Americano makes it appropriate for cooler weather—less summery than a paloma but still refreshing.

**Modern Technique:**

Using 8 dashes of bitters (rather than the standard 2-3) represents modern bartending's more aggressive use of bitters as a primary flavor component rather than just a subtle accent. This creates a drink where grapefruit is a starring flavor, not just a background note.

Nice & Toasty exemplifies contemporary American craft cocktails: spirit-forward but complex, technically sophisticated (flaming, precise stirring, bitters as primary ingredient), and designed for social media sharing with its dramatic flamed garnish.
