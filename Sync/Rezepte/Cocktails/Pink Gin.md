# History
The "Pink Gin" has a rich history, originating in the mid-19th century with the British Royal Navy.

**Origin and History:**
The cocktail was initially conceived as a medicinal remedy for seasickness. Sailors were given Angostura bitters for their therapeutic properties, but due to their unpalatable taste, gin (specifically Plymouth gin) was added to make them more enjoyable. This combination of gin and bitters quickly gained popularity among the naval officers and eventually spread to the general public in England by the late 1800s, becoming a fashionable drink in bars and high-class gatherings.

**Meaning:**
The name "Pink Gin" comes from the rosy or pinkish tint that the Angostura bitters impart to the gin. The traditional Pink Gin cocktail consists simply of gin and a dash of Angostura bitters, often served with a lemon twist and sometimes a splash of water.

In recent years, the term "Pink Gin" has also evolved to describe a distinct category of gin spirits. This modern interpretation refers to gins that are infused with fruits like strawberries, raspberries, or rhubarb, or botanicals such as rose petals or hibiscus, to give them a pink color and often a sweeter, fruitier flavor profile. This contemporary trend is largely separate from the historical cocktail and reflects a broader interest in colorful and flavored spirits.
