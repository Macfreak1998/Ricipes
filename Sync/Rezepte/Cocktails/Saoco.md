# History
The Saoco cocktail is a refreshing Cuban drink with a history stretching back to the 19th century. Its name, "Saoco," is believed to have African origins, brought by the Afro-Cuban community, and is associated with "flavor," "rhythm," or "music."

Historically, the Saoco was a simple concoction born out of necessity and resourcefulness among Cuban campesinos (farmers). It was also utilized as a medicinal tonic by Cuban slaves during the era of slavery. The original recipe typically involved aguardiente rum, fresh coconut water, and sometimes lime and sugar, often served with ice directly in a green coconut shell.

Today, the Saoco remains a classic Cuban cocktail, enjoyed on sun-kissed beaches and in famous establishments like El Floridita. While aguardiente was traditionally used, light rum is now common. The core ingredients remain rum and fresh coconut water, providing a vibrant and tropical blend. This recipe, with white rum and coconut milk, is a classic example of this enduring Cuban cocktail.
