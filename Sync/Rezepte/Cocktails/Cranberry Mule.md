# History
The Cranberry Mule is a modern, festive twist on the classic Moscow Mule. The original Moscow Mule, a refreshing mix of vodka, ginger beer, and lime juice, was created in the 1940s. The story goes that it was invented as a marketing ploy to sell more Smirnoff vodka, which was not a popular spirit in the United States at the time. The drink was traditionally served in a copper mug, which helped to keep it cold and also became a signature part of its identity.

The Cranberry Mule is a recent variation that adds cranberry juice to the classic recipe. This gives the drink a festive red color and a tart, fruity flavor that pairs well with the spicy ginger beer. It has become a popular cocktail for the holiday season, but it can be enjoyed year-round.
