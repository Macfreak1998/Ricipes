# History
The Clara Bow is a modern craft cocktail created by Garret Richard of Slowly Shirley (@drinksat6) in New York City, highlighted by @theeducatedbarfly as: "Kicking off the week with an original from none other than the formidable @drinksat6 this drink is perfect for that fall weather just starting to hit LA now! It's my favorite season that hooks us right into the Holidays. Give it a whirl! You won't regret it!"

**The Name:**

Clara Bow (1905-1965) was an American actress who became a major Hollywood star in the 1920s silent film era, known as "The It Girl." She represented the Roaring Twenties' flapper culture, embodying youth, energy, and rebellion. Naming a cocktail after her evokes Jazz Age glamour and vintage Hollywood sophistication.

**Slowly Shirley:**

The cocktail comes from Slowly Shirley, a notable New York City cocktail bar on the Lower East Side known for creative, well-balanced drinks. Garret Richard is part of NYC's craft cocktail scene, which emphasizes historical knowledge combined with modern technique.

**Flavor Profile:**

The Clara Bow combines several classic sour elements with unusual twists:

- **Bourbon**: Provides vanilla, oak, and caramel base notes
- **St. Germain (Elderflower Liqueur)**: Adds floral sweetness and lychee-like complexity
- **Lemon Juice**: Bright acidity typical of sours
- **Grenadine**: Real pomegranate syrup (not the artificial red syrup) adds fruit depth and color
- **Fresh Mint**: Muddled mint adds cooling herbaceousness

**Seasonal Positioning:**

The Educated Barfly's description as "perfect for that fall weather" is telling. While mint typically signals summer drinks, this cocktail's combination of bourbon's warmth, elderflower's delicate floral notes, and pomegranate's autumnal character makes it ideal for early fall—that transition period between summer refreshment and winter warming drinks.

**The "Hooks Us Into The Holidays" Philosophy:**

The mention of fall as the season "that hooks us right into the Holidays" reflects bartenders' approach to seasonal menus. Fall cocktails often incorporate elements that bridge summer's brightness with winter's richness, using ingredients like pomegranate, apple, and warming spices.

**Modern Classic Status:**

Being featured by The Educated Barfly suggests this drink has achieved recognition beyond Slowly Shirley's menu, entering the repertoire of cocktails that bartenders share and remake. This kind of cross-bar influence is how modern classics are born.

**Technical Notes:**

The 6-10 mint leaves specification shows careful consideration—enough to provide mint character without overwhelming the drink's other flavors. This restraint separates craft cocktails from overly minty drinks.

The Clara Bow represents contemporary New York cocktail culture: historically inspired names, balanced modern recipes, seasonal ingredients, and drinks that work for both serious cocktail enthusiasts and casual drinkers looking for something special.
