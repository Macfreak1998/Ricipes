# History
The "Red Mouth" cocktail appears to be a unique or obscure recipe, as there is no widely documented historical information about a cocktail with this specific name. It is likely a personal creation or a specialty drink from a particular establishment.

The recipe itself is for a hot drink, combining heavy cream, Cherry Heering (a cherry liqueur), and white rum. This suggests a rich, warming, and fruity profile, perhaps intended as a dessert drink or a comforting beverage for colder weather. While its specific origins are unknown, it stands as an example of creative mixology outside of the established classic cocktail canon. The name "Red Mouth" could be a playful reference to the color imparted by the Cherry Heering.
