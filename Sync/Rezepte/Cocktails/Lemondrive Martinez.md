# History
The "Lemondrive Martinez" cocktail is a classic drink that is essentially a rendition of the historic "Martinez cocktail," often considered the forerunner to the modern Martini. The "Lemondrive" in its name likely refers to a specific brand, a creative element, or a particular flavor profile, but the recipe itself aligns with the traditional Martinez.

The **Martinez cocktail** has a rich history, with its exact origins debated, but it likely emerged in the mid-19th century in California. It first appeared in print in the late 1800s, with recipes found in O.H. Byron's 1884 "Modern Bartender's Guide" and Jerry Thomas's 1887 "Bartender's Guide." One popular theory suggests the cocktail was named after the city of Martinez, California, where a gold miner in 1849 was supposedly served a "Martinez Special." Another story credits Jerry Thomas with creating the drink for a customer traveling to Martinez. The Martinez predates both the dry Martini and the Manhattan, and over time, the name "Martinez" is thought to have evolved into "Martini," with the recipe also shifting, particularly with the move from sweeter Old Tom gin to drier London Dry gin.

The Martinez is known for its layered flavors, combining the richness of gin with the complexity of sweet vermouth, a touch of maraschino liqueur, and orange bitters. Early versions typically used Old Tom gin, which is sweeter and fuller-bodied, resulting in an aromatic and gently sweet cocktail.

This "Lemondrive Martinez" recipe features Old Tom Gin, Vermouth Rose (likely a sweet vermouth), Maraschino Liqueur, and Angostura Bitters. It is a faithful representation of the classic Martinez, offering an aromatic and gently sweet cocktail that showcases the historical roots of the Martini.
