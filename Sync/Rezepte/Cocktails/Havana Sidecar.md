# History
The "Havana Sidecar" is a variation of the classic Sidecar cocktail, with its name signifying a Cuban-inspired twist on the traditional drink.

The classic **Sidecar cocktail** is generally believed to have originated around the end of World War I in either London or Paris. Its traditional ingredients are Cognac (or brandy), orange liqueur (such as Cointreau or triple sec), and lemon juice. Popular theories credit its creation to Harry MacElhone at Harry's New York Bar in Paris in 1922, or to Frank Meier at the Ritz Hotel in Paris. The drink is widely believed to be named after the motorcycle sidecar, a common sight at the time, or a regular patron who used one. The first published recipes appeared in 1922.

The "Havana Sidecar" takes the structure of the classic Sidecar and infuses it with the flavors associated with Cuban cocktails. The key difference in a Havana Sidecar is the substitution of Cognac (brandy) with Cuban rum (or gold rum, as in this recipe) as the base spirit. It often uses lime juice instead of lemon juice, further enhancing its tropical, Cuban profile. This particular recipe features Lime Juice, Triple Sec, and Gold Rum, creating a refreshing and vibrant rum-based cocktail that pays homage to Cuban mixology.
