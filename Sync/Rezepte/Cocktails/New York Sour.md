# History
The "New York Sour" cocktail, a sophisticated twist on the classic Whiskey Sour, emerged during the height of American cocktail culture in the late 19th century, specifically around the 1870s or 1880s. While its name suggests a New York origin, it is widely speculated that the drink was first created by a bartender in Chicago in the 1880s.

Historically, the cocktail was known by several other names, including Continental Sour, Southern Whiskey Sour, Brunswick Sour, and Claret Snap, before the "New York Sour" moniker gained widespread recognition and stuck. Bartenders in New York City are credited with popularizing the drink, aiming to add an elegant touch to the traditional whiskey sour by incorporating a red wine float.

The significance of the New York Sour lies in its balanced flavor profile, combining sweet and sour notes, and its visually striking layered appearance. The red wine, typically floated on top, not only adds aromatic qualities and a fruity flavor but also creates a distinct golden-brown (from the whiskey) and deep red (from the wine) aesthetic, often complemented by a creamy white layer if egg white is used. This combination of simplicity in execution, impressive presentation, and complex taste has cemented its status as a timeless classic in the cocktail world.
