# History
The Rum Sour cocktail, a classic in mixology, boasts a history deeply intertwined with the evolution of rum itself and the broader "sour" cocktail family. While no single inventor is formally credited, its origins can be traced back several centuries.

The concept of combining a spirit with citrus and a sweetener, the fundamental structure of a sour, is believed to have been codified in the 19th century by American bartenders. However, the direct inspiration for the Rum Sour likely comes from the "grog" consumed by British sailors in the 18th century. These sailors mixed rum, lemon or lime juice, and sugar to combat scurvy and improve the taste of the often rudimentary rum available at the time.

The Rum Sour, along with other sour cocktails like the Gin Sour, gained formal recognition in print in Jerry Thomas's influential 1862 book, *The Bartender's Guide*. The basic Daiquiri, sometimes referred to as a Daiquiri sour, is also a form of rum sour. This recipe, with white rum, dark rum, lemon juice, simple syrup, and a cherry garnish, is a classic example of this enduring and refreshing cocktail.
