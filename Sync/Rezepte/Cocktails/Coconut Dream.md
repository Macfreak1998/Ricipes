# History
The "Coconut Dream" is a creamy, sweet cocktail primarily characterized by its distinct coconut flavor. While the exact details of its origin are not definitively known, it is widely assumed to have originated in the Caribbean around the 1960s. This assumption is based on the abundance of coconut liqueur in the region during that period and the limited export capabilities for food and beverages at the time.

The cocktail is celebrated for its ability to evoke a relaxed, summery, and Caribbean feeling, making it a popular choice among summer drinks. The name "Coconut Dream" itself suggests a fantastical or idealized experience associated with coconuts, often linked to tropical getaways and indulgent flavors. It is often associated with the tiki tradition of mixing rum with sweet fruit juices.
