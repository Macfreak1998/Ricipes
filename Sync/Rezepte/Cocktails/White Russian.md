# History
The White Russian cocktail, a blend of vodka, coffee liqueur, and cream, has a history rooted in its predecessor, the Black Russian. The Black Russian, consisting of only vodka and coffee liqueur, is believed to have been created in 1949 by Gustave Tops, a Belgian bartender at the Hotel Metropole in Brussels. He reportedly made it to honor Perle Mesta, the then U.S. ambassador to Luxembourg.

The White Russian emerged sometime in the 1950s with the addition of cream, a popular ingredient in sweet, milky drinks of that era. While the cocktail's name includes "Russian," it has no direct connection to Russia beyond vodka being its primary spirit. The name likely stems from vodka's origin, as most vodka exported to the United States at the time came from Russia.

The first documented mention of the White Russian cocktail in print appeared in California's Oakland Tribune on November 21, 1965. Despite its creation in the mid-20th century, the White Russian experienced a significant surge in popularity after being prominently featured in the 1998 cult film *The Big Lebowski*. The main character, "The Dude," frequently drinks White Russians throughout the movie, cementing its place in popular culture and saving it from potential obscurity. This recipe, with vodka, coffee liqueur, and heavy cream, is a classic example of this iconic and creamy cocktail.
