# History
The "Golden Cadillac" cocktail was created in 1952 by bartender Frank Klein (sometimes referred to as Frank Cline) at Poor Red's, a bar in El Dorado, California.

The cocktail's origin story involves a newly engaged couple who arrived at Poor Red's in their new gold-colored Cadillac, on their way to Lake Tahoe to celebrate. They asked the bartender to create a special drink in their honor. Inspired by the couple's shiny new car and the drink's slight golden tint, Klein named the cocktail the "Golden Cadillac."

The drink is a sweet and creamy mid-century cocktail, typically made with equal parts Galliano liqueur, white crème de cacao, and heavy cream. It gained significant popularity in the 1970s, partly due to a marketing campaign by the Galliano liqueur brand, which noticed an in-crease in sales in the Northern California region after the drink's creation. Poor Red's still claims to serve more Galliano than any other establishment in the world.
