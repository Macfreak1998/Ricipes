# History
The "Pencil Thin Mustache" cocktail was created by Dustin Olson of Forrest Point in Brooklyn, NY. Its name likely draws inspiration from the 1974 Jimmy Buffett song "Pencil Thin Mustache," which is a nostalgic reflection on the popular culture of Buffett's childhood. The song's title itself refers to the distinctive mustache style sported by characters like Boston Blackie, Ricky Ricardo, and Errol Flynn.

The cocktail's ingredients include Leblon Cachaça, Fernet-Branca, pineapple juice, lime juice, and mint syrup, garnished with fresh mint. While there's no explicit statement about the cocktail's deeper meaning, the connection to Buffett's song suggests an evocation of a bygone era and a playful nod to classic pop culture references. The presence of mint and lime in the cocktail could also subtly hint at other themes found in Buffett's music.
