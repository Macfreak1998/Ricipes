# History
The "Delmonico" cocktail is a classic drink with a rich history tied to one of America's most iconic restaurants. It is named after and is believed to have originated at Delmonico's Restaurant in New York City. Delmonico's, established in 1827 (or 1837), is widely recognized as the first fine-dining restaurant in the United States, known for its culinary innovations and significant influence on American gastronomy and cocktail culture. The cocktail's appearance in Albert Stevens Crockett's 1935 *Old Waldorf-Astoria Bar Book* further solidifies its historical presence. Cocktail historian David Wondrich suggests the drink likely emerged around 1876, coinciding with the increased availability of both sweet and dry vermouth in the United States.

The "Delmonico" cocktail doesn't have a single, universally agreed-upon recipe, but several interpretations exist, all reflecting a sophisticated and spirit-forward profile. One common understanding describes the Delmonico as essentially a Manhattan cocktail where cognac is substituted for whiskey. Another prominent version, sometimes referred to as the "Delmonico No. 1," combines gin, brandy, sweet vermouth, dry vermouth, and orange bitters, often garnished with a lemon twist. This rendition is considered a "perfect" Manhattan variation due to its use of equal parts sweet and dry vermouth, with gin and brandy replacing the traditional whiskey.

Overall, the Delmonico cocktail is characterized as a "boozy, smooth, and aromatic drink" that embodies the refinement and elegance associated with the legendary Delmonico's Restaurant.
