# History
The Red Headed Slut shot is a popular cocktail believed to have originated in Ohio at O'Grady's Pub in 2000. It gained popularity among college-aged adults, partly due to its intriguing and provocative name.

The drink typically consists of equal parts Jägermeister, peach schnapps, and cranberry juice. The vibrant red color of the drink is said to be the inspiration for its name. While its exact origins are not entirely clear, it is thought to have been created by a bartender looking to invent a new, catchy drink.

The Red Headed Slut shot is known by several alternative names, including "Ginger Bitch" and "Slutty Red Head." It remains a popular party shot in various parts of the world.
