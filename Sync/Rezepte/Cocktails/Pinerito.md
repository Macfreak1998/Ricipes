# History
The "Pinerito cocktail," as presented in this recipe, is a modern and creative drink that does not have a widely documented historical origin. The name "Pinerito" is not associated with a recognized historical cocktail and is likely a unique or personal name for this specific concoction, perhaps a playful or diminutive form of "Piña" (pineapple) or a similar tropical reference.

This cocktail features Lime Juice, Grenadine, Simple Syrup, Grapefruit Juice, and White Rum. This combination creates a vibrant, fruity, and refreshing rum-based drink. The white rum provides a clean base, while the lime and grapefruit juices contribute a tart and sweet citrus profile. Grenadine and simple syrup add sweetness and a beautiful reddish hue, making it a visually appealing and flavorful cocktail that evokes a tropical feel.
