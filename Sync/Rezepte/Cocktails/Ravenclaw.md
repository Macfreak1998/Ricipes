# History
The Ravenclaw cocktail is a modern, fan-created drink inspired by the Ravenclaw house from the Harry Potter series. It does not have a singular, established historical origin as a classic cocktail. Instead, various mixologists and enthusiasts have developed their own unique recipes to embody the house's characteristics and colors (blue and bronze or silver).

These themed cocktails aim to reflect Ravenclaw's traits of wit, learning, and wisdom, often incorporating blue ingredients to represent the house color. This recipe, with gin, blue curaçao, lemon juice, and Prosecco, creates a vibrant blue drink that aligns with the visual representation of the Ravenclaw house. The emergence of the Ravenclaw cocktail is part of a broader trend of Harry Potter-themed drinks, with creations for all Hogwarts houses.
