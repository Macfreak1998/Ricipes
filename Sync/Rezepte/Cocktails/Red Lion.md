# History
The Red Lion cocktail was invented by Arthur Tarling, the head bartender at London's Café Royal, in 1933. Tarling's creation won first prize in the British Empire Cocktail Competition that year, and the recipe was first published in 1937 in the "Café Royal Cocktail Book," authored by his older brother, W.J. "Billy" Tarling.

The original Red Lion recipe featured gin, orange liqueur (specifically Grand Marnier), and a combination of lemon and orange juice. The cocktail's name is believed to reference the red lion logo of Booth's Gin, a brand stipulated in the original recipe. While later versions sometimes included grenadine to give the drink a redder hue, Tarling's original cocktail was not red but a murky yellow. This recipe, with gin, orange curaçao, orange juice, lemon juice, and grenadine, is a popular interpretation of this classic award-winning cocktail.
