# History
The "Long Island Iced Tea" is a popular cocktail known for its potent blend of spirits and its deceptive appearance.

**Origin:**
There are two primary competing theories regarding the origin of the Long Island Iced Tea:
*   **Prohibition Era (1920s), Long Island, Tennessee:** One account attributes the drink to "Old Man Bishop" from a community called Long Island in Kingsport, Tennessee. During Prohibition, he allegedly created a strong alcoholic concoction that resembled iced tea to conceal its true nature. His son, Ransom Bishop, is said to have refined this recipe in the 1940s by adding cola, lemon, and lime.
*   **1970s, Long Island, New York:** A more recent and widely cited origin credits Robert "Rosebud" Butt, a bartender at the Oak Beach Inn on Long Island, New York. He claims to have invented the drink in 1972 for a cocktail creation contest that required the use of triple sec. Some evidence, such as similar recipes appearing in cookbooks in the 1960s, lends more credibility to the Tennessee origin story, predating Butt's claim.

**Meaning:**
The cocktail is called "Long Island Iced Tea" because its amber color and sometimes its taste visually resemble non-alcoholic iced tea. Despite its name, the drink typically contains no actual tea. This resemblance was particularly useful during Prohibition, allowing drinkers to consume alcohol discreetly. The drink is known for its high alcohol concentration due to the combination of several spirits with a relatively small amount of mixer.

**Typical Ingredients:**
A modern Long Island Iced Tea typically includes vodka, gin, white rum, tequila, triple sec, lemon juice, simple syrup, and a splash of cola. This particular recipe features Gin, White Rum, Vodka, Tequila Blanco, Cointreau, Lemon Juice, Simple Syrup, and Cola, creating a potent and deceptively refreshing drink.
