# History
The Stinger cocktail, a duo drink typically made with brandy (often Cognac) and crème de menthe, originated in the United States around 1890. It quickly gained popularity in New York City and was considered a "society" drink, favored by the upper classes.

While its exact inventor is unknown, the Stinger may have evolved from "The Judge," a similar cocktail found in William Schmidt's 1892 cocktail book, *The Flowing Bowl*. The Stinger remained a significant cocktail until Prohibition.

Reginald Vanderbilt, a prominent millionaire, is often credited with popularizing the Stinger, and some urban legends even attribute its invention to him. Vanderbilt was known for serving Stingers to his guests, and his association with the drink solidified its high-society image. He famously described it in 1923 as "a short drink with a long reach, a subtle blend of ardent nectars, a boon to friendship, a dispeller of care."

The Stinger's reputation led to its appearance in several cultural works, including the 1956 film *High Society* and the James Bond novel *Diamonds Are Forever*. The cocktail maintained its popularity in the United States until about the 1970s. Traditionally, the Stinger is served chilled in a coupe glass as a digestif or after-dinner drink. This recipe, with cognac and crème de menthe white, is a classic example of this enduring and sophisticated cocktail.
