# History
The "Dead Man's Handle" cocktail was created by Tiffany Kirk at the Miss Carousel bar in Houston, USA, around 2019. This vibrant, citrus-forward drink is a modern take on the Sour cocktail family, drawing inspiration from classic recipes.

The name "Dead Man's Handle" is a reference to a safety device known as a "dead man's switch" or "dead man's handle." This mechanism is commonly found on trains and other machinery, designed to stop the equipment or return it to a safe state if the operator becomes incapacitated or releases their grip. The cocktail's name playfully alludes to this concept, implying that the drink itself is a "killer combo" that one would be reluctant to release.
