# History
The "Ladies Sidecar" cocktail is a modern interpretation of the classic "Sidecar" cocktail, likely named to evoke a lighter, fruitier, or more approachable version of the traditional drink. While there is no specific historical or origin information for a distinct "Ladies Sidecar cocktail," it builds upon the rich history of its predecessor.

The classic **Sidecar cocktail** is generally believed to have originated around the end of World War I in either London or Paris. Its traditional ingredients are Cognac (or brandy), orange liqueur (such as Cointreau or triple sec), and lemon juice. Popular theories credit its creation to Harry MacElhone at Harry's New York Bar in Paris in 1922, or to Frank Meier at the Ritz Hotel in Paris. The drink is widely believed to be named after the motorcycle sidecar, a common sight at the time, or a regular patron who used one. The first published recipes appeared in 1922.

This "Ladies Sidecar" recipe features Lemon Juice, Triple Sec, Orange Juice, and Brandy. It maintains the core elements of a Sidecar (brandy, orange liqueur, citrus) but introduces orange juice, which adds a layer of sweetness and fruitiness, making it a more mellow and perhaps "ladylike" version compared to the drier, more spirit-forward classic. It offers a refreshing and balanced profile, perfect for those who prefer a slightly sweeter and fruitier brandy cocktail.
