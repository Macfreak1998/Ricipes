# History
The "Casablanca" cocktail is named after the iconic 1942 romantic drama film starring Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergmaccordingly. The movie, set in the Vichy-controlled city of Casablanca during World War II, features numerous references to drinking, which inspired the creation of cocktails in its honor. The cocktail itself is often described as a "classic style recipe" rather than a historical classic with a long, established lineage.

The meaning behind the cocktail is directly tied to the romantic and wartime themes of the movie, evoking the atmosphere of Rick's Café Americain, the film's central setting.

This particular recipe, featuring Vodka, Advocaat, Lemon Juice, and Orange Juice, is a unique interpretation of a "Casablanca" cocktail. While common "Casablanca" recipes often include rum, lime juice, orange curaçao, and maraschino liqueur, this version offers a creamy, citrusy, and vodka-based profile, perhaps aiming for a smoother, more dessert-like experience.
