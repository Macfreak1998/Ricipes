# History
There are two prominent cocktails known as "Outlander." This recipe refers to the modern bar creation by bartender Mikki Kristola at The Varnish in Los Angeles. It gained recognition when featured by "The Educated Barfly" as a tribute to The Varnish.

The name "Outlander" for this cocktail likely plays on its Scotch base, reminiscent of the "Highlander" cocktail, and perhaps suggests something distinct or "out of the ordinary" in its flavor profile, combining Scotch with maraschino, absinthe, and Peychaud's bitters. It's described as a mash-up of a Scotch Fancy Free and an Improved Scotch Cocktail.
