# History
The Florodora cocktail is a classic gin-based drink named after a popular Broadway musical that premiered in 1899 in London and 1900 in New York. The musical was renowned for its chorus line of "Florodora Girls," and the cocktail is believed to have been created by a bartender at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York to honor these performers. The drink quickly gained popularity in New York's high society and remained a common choice through Prohibition and the mid-20th century.

The Florodora cocktail's bright pink color and bubbly nature were said to mirror the aesthetics and spirited vitality of the Florodora girls. It was considered "theater in a glass," embodying the glamour and cultural prominence of Broadway. The musical itself featured a fictitious Philippine island named Florodora and a perfume factory producing a fragrance of the same name. The cocktail's name, therefore, directly references this popular cultural phenomenon of its era.
