# History
The "Piña Colada," a popular cocktail made with rum, cream of coconut, and pineapple juice, holds a rich history with contested origins, primarily rooted in Puerto Rico.

**Meaning:**
The name "Piña Colada" is Spanish for "strained pineapple," referring to the freshly pressed and strained pineapple juice traditionally used in its preparation.

**Origin and History:**
The exact origin of the Piña Colada is debated, with several individuals and establishments claiming its creation:
*   **Folk Origins (19th Century):** An early folktale suggests that Puerto Rican pirate Roberto Cofresí, in the 1800s, gave his crew a beverage containing coconut, pineapple, and white rum to boost morale. However, the recipe was reportedly lost after his death in 1825.
*   **Early Mentions (1920s-1950s):** In 1922, *Travel* magazine described a "Piña Colada" as a drink with sugar, lime, ice, pineapple juice, and Bacardi rum, though it did not include coconut. By 1950, *The New York Times* reported on Cuba's "pina colada" containing rum, pineapple, and coconut milk.
*   **Modern Creation Claims (1950s-1960s):**
    *   **Ramón "Monchito" Marrero:** The Caribe Hilton Hotel in San Juan, Puerto Rico, claims that bartender Ramón "Monchito" Marrero created the modern Piña Colada in 1954 (or 1952, according to some accounts) using the newly available Coco López cream of coconut. He reportedly perfected the recipe to capture the essence of Puerto Rico.
    *   **Ricardo Garcia:** Another bartender at the Caribe Hilton Hotel, Ricardo Garcia, also claims to have invented the drink in 1953.
    *   **Ramón Portas Mingot:** Ramón Portas Mingot, a bartender at the Barrachina Restaurant in Old San Juan, claims to have created the Piña Colada in 1963. The restaurant displays a plaque supporting his claim.

Despite the conflicting claims, Puerto Rico declared the Piña Colada its official national drink in 1978. Its popularity soared globally, partly due to tourism and further cemented by Rupert Holmes' 1979 hit song "Escape" (often referred to as "The Piña Colada Song"). Today, it remains a quintessential summer cocktail, synonymous with tropical getaways.
