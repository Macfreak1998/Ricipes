# History
The "Lemondrive Julep" cocktail is a modern and creative drink that does not have a widely documented historical origin. It is a variation of the classic "Julep" cocktail, with the "Lemondrive" in its name likely referring to a specific brand, a creative element, or a particular flavor profile.

The "Julep cocktail," most famously known as the Mint Julep, boasts a rich history and a fascinating evolution from a medicinal concoction to an iconic American drink. The term "julep" itself is derived from the Persian word "gulab" (or Arabic "julab"), meaning rosewater, and historically referred to sweet drinks, often used to make medicine more palatable. The julep's origins can be traced back to Persia, and it reached America in the 18th century, initially as a daily health elixir made with rum or brandy, honey, and muddled mint. By the early 19th century, the julep became a favorite among the Southern elite in America, particularly in Virginia. While initially made with brandy or rum, bourbon gradually became the standard as its production increased in Kentucky.

This "Lemondrive Julep" recipe features Fresh Mint, Tullamore Dew Whiskey, and Simple Syrup. It is a whiskey-based julep, offering a refreshing and herbaceous drink with the distinct character of Irish whiskey. It embodies the spirit of adaptation and creativity in mixology, building upon a historical classic to create a new, distinct experience.
