# History
The "Honeysuckle" cocktail has its origins in the Prohibition era, emerging as a way to improve the taste of bootleg rum. During this time, honey and citrus were used to camouflage the harsh flavors of illicitly produced spirits. Despite its utilitarian beginnings, the drink proved to be enjoyable enough to persist even after higher-quality rum became widely available.

The Honeysuckle Daiquiri, a notable variation of the cocktail, was first documented in David A. Embury's 1948 publication, "The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks."

In terms of its profile, the Honeysuckle cocktail is characterized by a bright, citrusy, floral, mellow, and rich flavor. It is often described as a refreshing and smooth drink, particularly well-suited for warm weather. The honey contributes a mellow, rich, and subtly floral sweetness, which is balanced by the sharp, bright notes of lime.

The primary ingredients for a Honeysuckle cocktail typically include rum (often white rum), honey (or honey syrup), and lime juice. This particular recipe features White Rum, Lime Juice, and Honey Syrup, creating a classic and refreshing rum sour with a delightful honey sweetness.
