# History
The "Hot Jamaican" cocktail, as presented in this recipe, is a warm, spiced rum drink designed to evoke the flavors and spirit of Jamaica. While there isn't a single, universally recognized "Hot Jamaican cocktail" with a distinct historical origin, it draws inspiration from the island's rich rum heritage and tradition of warm beverages.

Jamaica has a deep history of rum production, dating back to at least 1494. During the Anglo-Spanish War (1654-1660), the British Navy began using Jamaican rum as a replacement for brandy rations, leading to its widespread use. This rich history of rum production has led to a diverse array of cocktails, both hot and cold, that showcase the unique flavors of Jamaican rum.

This "Hot Jamaican" cocktail combines Lime Juice, Simple Syrup, Dark Rum, boiling water, Cloves, and a Cinnamon Stick. It is a comforting and aromatic drink, perfect for cooler evenings. The dark rum provides a rich base, while the lime juice adds a touch of brightness, and the cloves and cinnamon stick infuse it with warming spices, creating a delightful and evocative taste of Jamaica.
