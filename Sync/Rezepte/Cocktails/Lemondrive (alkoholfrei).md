# History
The "Lemondrive (alkoholfrei)" appears to be a unique, non-alcoholic creation, rather than a historically documented cocktail. Its name likely aims to evoke a sense of refreshing, citrus-driven energy, similar to a "lemon drive."

This particular recipe, combining coconut syrup, lime juice, and pineapple juice, suggests a tropical and sweet-and-sour flavor profile. It's a modern mocktail designed to offer a vibrant and flavorful experience without the addition of alcohol. While it doesn't have a long, established history, it fits within the growing trend of creative and sophisticated non-alcoholic beverages.
