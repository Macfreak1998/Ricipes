# History
The "Screwdriver" cocktail is traditionally made with vodka and orange juice. Its history is somewhat debated, but it is generally believed to have originated around World War II. One popular story suggests that American oil workers in the Persian Gulf secretly mixed vodka into their orange juice and, lacking spoons, used screwdrivers to stir the drink, thus giving it its name.

The cocktail gained significant visibility and popularity in the United States in the mid-20th century. While the classic Screwdriver uses vodka, the "Rum Screwdriver" is a straightforward variation that substitutes rum for vodka. This adaptation allows for a different flavor profile, often with a more tropical or molasses-rich character, while maintaining the simple and refreshing combination of spirit and orange juice. It's a popular choice for those who prefer rum or are looking for a simple, fruity, and easy-to-make cocktail.
