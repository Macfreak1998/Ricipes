# History
The "Lemondrop" cocktail originated in the 1970s, created by Norman Jay Hobday at his San Francisco bar, Henry Africa's. Henry Africa's was a pioneering "fern bar," known for its plant-filled decor and its aim to attract a female clientele. The Lemondrop was specifically developed as a "dessert drink" to appeal to women during a period when single women were increasingly socializing in bars.

The cocktail's name is believed to be derived from lemon drop candies, reflecting its characteristic sweet and sour taste. It is a vodka-based cocktail, typically made with vodka (plain or citrus-flavored), triple sec, and fresh lemon juice, offering a balanced lemony flavor. Some recipes also include simple syrup. It is traditionally served chilled and strained into a cocktail or martini glass, often with a sugared rim to complement the tartness of the lemon. While sometimes described as a vodka martini variant, it is more accurately considered akin to a daisy or white lady cocktail.
