# History
The Vermouth Cassis cocktail, a popular wine-based drink in France, dates back to at least the early 1880s, with mentions in French newspapers as early as 1882. This classic aperitif combines the herbal notes of vermouth with the sweet and fruity taste of crème de cassis, a blackcurrant liqueur of French origin. It is typically made with dry vermouth, crème de cassis, and sparkling water.

The cocktail gained popularity in France and reached the United States in the 1930s, enjoying a brief vogue there after Prohibition ended. In the US, it was sometimes known as a "Pompier," meaning "fireman" in French. The Vermouth Cassis remained very popular in France until the late 1960s.

It is also considered the progenitor of two significant variations: the Blanc-Cassis (which replaces vermouth with white wine) and the Kir (named after Canon Félix Kir, who promoted the Blanc-Cassis). The Kir Royal, which uses sparkling wine or champagne, further evolved from this tradition. This recipe, with dry vermouth, crème de cassis, and soda water, is a classic example of this simple and refreshing French aperitif.
