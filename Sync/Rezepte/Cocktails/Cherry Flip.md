# History
The "Cherry Flip" is a historical cocktail that belongs to a broader category of mixed drinks known as "flips." Its origins can be traced back to the late 17th century.

The term "flip" first appeared in 1695, originally referring to a concoction of ale, sugar, and spices. This mixture was traditionally heated with a red-hot iron poker, a process that caused the drink to froth or "flip," giving it its name. This early version was a popular "sailor's drink" in colonial America and remained common in English and American taverns until the 19th century.

Over time, the recipe for flips evolved significantly. Eggs were introduced, the amount of sugar increased, and the ale was eventually removed. The preparation method also changed, moving away from the hot poker to being shaken cold in a cocktail shaker. The "father of American mixology," Jerry Thomas, published the first printed flip recipes in his 1862 *Bar-Tender's Guide*.

The "Cherry Flip" is a specific variation of the flip cocktail, distinguished by its use of cherry brandy or a similar cherry-flavored spirit as its base. Like other flips, it typically includes a whole raw egg, a sweetener, and is often garnished with grated nutmeg. Flips are similar in flavor profile to eggnog but do not contain cream.

In modern times, flips, including the Cherry Flip, have largely fallen out of favor in many bars. This decline is primarily due to the use of raw eggs, which raises concerns about potential salmonella contamination, especially since contemporary egg washing practices remove the natural protective coating that once helped prevent such issues.
