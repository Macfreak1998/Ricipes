# History
The "Smoked Old Fashioned with Maple & Pecan Bitters" is a modern interpretation of the classic Old Fashioned cocktail, rather than a drink with a singular, long-standing historical origin. Its creation reflects a convergence of several cocktail trends and historical developments.

The Old Fashioned is one of the oldest known cocktails, with its roots tracing back to the early 19th century, initially defined as a "potent concoction of spirits, bitters, water, and sugar." The term "Old Fashioned" gained popularity in the 1880s as drinkers requested simpler, traditional drinks.

The trend of incorporating smoke into cocktails gained significant traction around 2007, adding an extra layer of aromatic complexity and flavor. Simultaneously, the craft cocktail movement led to a resurgence and diversification of bitters, including a wide array of flavor profiles. Maple and pecan flavors, whether in the form of bitters or infused syrups, represent a contemporary development in this evolution, offering warm, nutty, and sweet notes that complement whiskey-based cocktails.

In essence, this cocktail builds upon the foundational structure of the traditional Old Fashioned by integrating modern techniques like smoking and incorporating specialized flavor components such as maple syrup and pecan bitters. It emerged as bartenders and enthusiasts experimented with new ways to enhance classic drinks, offering a sophisticated and multi-layered experience.
