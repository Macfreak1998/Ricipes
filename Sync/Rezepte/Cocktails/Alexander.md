# History
The "Alexander" cocktail is a classic, creamy drink with a history rooted in the early 20th century. The original Alexander cocktail, consisting of equal parts gin, crème de cacao, and cream, first appeared in Hugo Ensslin's 1916 "Recipes for Mixed Drinks."

Several individuals and events are linked to its creation:
*   **Troy Alexander:** One prominent theory credits Troy Alexander, a bartender at Rector's, a pre-Prohibition lobster restaurant in New York City. He is believed to have created the drink for a dinner celebrating the "Phoebe Snow" advertising campaign for the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad. The cocktail's white appearance was intended to match Phoebe Snow's pristine white dress.
*   **Grover Cleveland Alexander:** Another theory suggests the drink was created to honor Philadelphia pitcher Grover Cleveland Alexander, possibly around the time of the 1915 World Series.

While the original Alexander used gin, the "Brandy Alexander" emerged later, replacing gin with brandy. This variation appeared in Harry Craddock's 1930 "The Savoy Cocktail Book" and quickly gained popularity, becoming the more common version of the drink. The Alexander cocktail is known for its sweet, creamy, and dessert-like qualities, often garnished with grated nutmeg. Its smooth texture and indulgent taste made it a popular after-dinner drink.
