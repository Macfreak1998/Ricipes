# History
The "Casino" cocktail is a classic gin-based drink with a rich history rooted in the early 20th century. Its exact origin is somewhat debated, but it is believed to have emerged in the United States. Some sources credit Jacob A. Didier with its creation in 1909, while others point to Hugo R. Ensslin's 1917 publication "Recipes for Mixed Drinks," with the recipe later appearing in Harry Craddock's influential 1930 "The Savoy Cocktail Book."

The cocktail gained significant popularity during the Roaring Twenties, a period marked by the flourishing of casinos and the rise of mixology. It became a favored drink in speakeasies, symbolizing luxury and indulgence, much like the casinos themselves.

The name "Casino" is thought to be inspired by the glamorous ambiance of early 20th-century gaming establishments and the sophisticated clientele they attracted. The drink itself is seen as a blend of flavors and excitement, offering a taste of sophistication and thrill with every sip.

The Casino cocktail is typically made with gin, maraschino liqueur, lemon juice, and orange bitters. It is characterized as a sophisticated and refreshing drink, showcasing a beautifully balanced combination of citrus, the unique cherry notes of maraschino liqueur, and the aromatic complexity of orange bitters.
