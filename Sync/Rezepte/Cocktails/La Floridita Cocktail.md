# History
The "La Floridita Cocktail," as presented in this recipe, is a unique creation that draws inspiration from the legendary El Floridita bar in Havana, Cuba, renowned as "la cuna del daiquiri" or "the cradle of the daiquiri." While this specific combination of ingredients is not a widely documented historical cocktail from El Floridita, it pays homage to the bar's rich mixology heritage.

El Floridita first opened in 1817 under the name "La Piña de Plata" (The Silver Pineapple) and was later affectionately called "El Floridita" by locals. A pivotal figure in its history was Constantino Ribalaigua Vert, known as "Constante," who is widely credited with inventing the frozen daiquiri in the early 1930s, a creation that cemented the bar's fame. Ernest Hemingway, a famous writer, was a frequent patron and significantly contributed to the bar's and the Daiquiri's fame.

This "La Floridita Cocktail" recipe features Lime Juice, Grenadine, Crème de Cacao White, Sweet Vermouth, and White Rum. This blend creates a complex and fruity drink, combining the tropical notes of white rum with the tartness of lime, the sweetness of grenadine and crème de cacao, and the herbal notes of sweet vermouth. It is a creative interpretation that evokes the vibrant and innovative spirit of El Floridita's mixology.
