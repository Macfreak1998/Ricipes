# History
The "Pipeline" cocktail is a name that has been applied to at least two distinct drinks. The version described in this recipe is a rum-based cocktail, featuring white rum, apricot liqueur (sometimes referred to as apricot brandy), and lemon juice. It is a simple mixed drink, but its specific origin and historical development are not well-documented.

Another, more contemporary "Pipeline" cocktail is a vodka-based drink that gained popularity in Austria, Germany, and Switzerland around 2025. This version often includes ingredients like lime juice, almond syrup, pineapple juice, and muddled cucumber.

The name "Pipeline" itself might be a reference to the famous Hawaiian surf break, the "Banzai Pipeline," evoking a sense of tropical or adventurous themes. However, for this particular rum-based recipe, it remains a cocktail whose precise historical journey is largely unrecorded.
