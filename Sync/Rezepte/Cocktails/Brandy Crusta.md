# History
The "Brandy Crusta" cocktail, a classic with a rich history, originated in New Orleans in the 1850s. It was created by Joseph Santini, an Italian bartender who worked at either the City Exchange or his own establishment, the Jewel of the South saloon.

Historically, the Brandy Crusta is significant as one of the earliest cocktails to incorporate citrus juice and feature an elaborate, decorative garnish. Its prominence was cemented when it was included as the fourth drink illustrated in Jerry Thomas's influential 1862 "Bar-Tender's Guide." Many cocktail historians consider it a precursor to other well-known drinks such as the Sidecar and the Margarita.

The name "Crusta" directly refers to the cocktail's signature "crust" of sugar that rims the glass. This distinctive sugar rim, along with a large lemon peel often used to line the inside of the glass, was a key element of its presentation, distinguishing it as a "fancy" or "improved" cocktail during its era.
