# History
The "Adios Motherfucker" (AMF) cocktail is a potent, bright blue drink with a provocative name, often considered a variation of the Long Island Iced Tea. It originated in the United States in the 1980s, though some unverified accounts suggest its presence as early as the 1970s. It gained significant popularity in the 1990s, particularly in Southern California, and saw a resurgence in the 2010s. Anecdotal stories claim its invention by a bartender at a TGI Fridays in Orange, initially named "Adios Madre," which then evolved into "Adios Mother," and finally "Adios Motherfucker." Other accounts suggest its origin in the 1970s at establishments like The Creamery in San Luis Obispo or Studio Cafe in Balboa, California, where it was listed as "Adios Mother" on menus.

The cocktail's explicit name is often described as a "holdover from the bad old days of the late 20th century, when cocktails went for shock value over quality." Some interpretations suggest the name reflects the reaction of bartenders to an order for such a strong drink, or it implies that consuming it will lead to one being "out of control." Due to its strong nature and potentially offensive name, it is also known by several other aliases, including AMF, Walk Me Down, Blue Motorcycle, and Blue Long Island Iced Tea.

The Adios Motherfucker is essentially a Long Island Iced Tea with a twist. Instead of triple sec and cola, it features blue curaçao and a lemon-lime soda (such as Sprite or 7Up), which gives it its distinctive bright blue color. The cocktail typically combines five different spirits: vodka, gin, rum, tequila, and blue curaçao, along with sweet and sour mix and lemon-lime soda. It is renowned for its potency, often considered one of the strongest cocktails, with an alcohol content around 22%. Despite its strength, it is frequently described as sweet, citrusy, and refreshing, with a fizzy lemon-lime flavor.
