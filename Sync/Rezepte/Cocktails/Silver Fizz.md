# History

The Silver Fizz cocktail, a classic variation of the Gin Fizz, emerged in the early 1880s, appearing in New York and quickly gaining popularity across the United States. It is a vintage cocktail primarily composed of gin, lemon juice, sugar syrup, egg white, and soda water.



The inclusion of egg white is the defining characteristic of the Silver Fizz, distinguishing it from a regular Gin Fizz. This ingredient creates a frothy, creamy layer on top of the drink, which was described by the Chicago Tribune in 1883 as "a body of creamy liquid topped by about an inch of frothy foam."



The Silver Fizz is a direct descendant of the "Fizz" category of drinks, which evolved from the "Fix" cocktail popular in the first half of the 1800s. The "Fix" typically included an alcoholic base, lemon juice, sugar, ice, and water. The "Fizz" simply replaced the still water with soda, making the drink sparkling and more refreshing. The Silver Fizz further refined this by adding the egg white for texture and visual appeal. This recipe, with gin, lemon juice, simple syrup, egg white, and soda water, is a classic example of this enduring and refreshing cocktail.
