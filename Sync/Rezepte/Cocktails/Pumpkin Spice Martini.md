# History
The Pumpkin Spice Martini is a modern, seasonal cocktail that emerged from the widespread popularity of pumpkin spice flavors, particularly following the introduction of the Pumpkin Spice Latte in 2003. It represents an evolution of the "martini" concept, where the term broadly applies to various mixed drinks served in a martini glass, rather than adhering to the traditional gin or vodka and vermouth formula.

This cocktail is typically classified as a dessert drink, designed to combine the popular autumnal notes of pumpkin spice with an alcoholic base. While the cocktail itself is contemporary, the pumpkin spice blend has a longer history, tracing back to medieval "poudre-douce" and becoming a common ingredient in pumpkin pie by the 19th century. The Pumpkin Spice Martini is a festive and indulgent drink, perfect for the fall and winter seasons.
