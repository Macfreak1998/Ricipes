# History
The "Gin & Bitters" cocktail, more commonly known as "Pink Gin," has a rich history, originating in the 19th century with the British Royal Navy.

The cocktail was initially conceived as a medicinal remedy for seasickness. Sailors were given Angostura bitters, a potent concoction developed in 1824 by Dr. Johann Gottlieb Benjamin Siegert, to help settle their stomachs. However, the bitters were intensely unpalatable on their own. To make them more enjoyable, sailors began mixing them with their daily ration of gin, often Plymouth gin. The addition of the dark red Angostura bitters imparted a rosy or pinkish hue to the drink, leading to its name, "Pink Gin."

This naval tradition eventually made its way to England, becoming fashionable in bars and clubs by the 1870s and gaining popularity with the general public.

Traditionally, a "Pink Gin" cocktail is simple, consisting of gin (historically Plymouth gin) and a dash of Angostura bitters, stirred over ice and strained into a chilled glass. A lemon twist is a common garnish. Some variations might include topping it with soda water or tonic. The term "Pink Gin" traditionally referred specifically to this cocktail.

In recent years, the term "Pink Gin" has also evolved to describe a distinct category of gin spirits. These modern "pink gins" are typically infused with various fruits and flavorings, such as strawberries, raspberries, or rhubarb, which give them a pink color and often a sweeter, fruitier profile. This contemporary trend is largely driven by aesthetics and a preference for sweeter drinks, and is distinct from the historical cocktail.
