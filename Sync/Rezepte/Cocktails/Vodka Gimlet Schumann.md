Schumann's version

# History
This "Vodka Gimlet Schumann" is a specific version of the Vodka Gimlet, likely created or popularized by the renowned German bartender Charles Schumann. While the exact date of Schumann's specific rendition is not widely documented, it builds upon the history of the broader Vodka Gimlet.

The Vodka Gimlet itself is a modern adaptation of the classic Gin Gimlet, a cocktail with roots in the 19th-century British Royal Navy. The original Gimlet was conceived as a medicinal drink to combat scurvy, a debilitating disease caused by vitamin C deficiency that was prevalent among sailors during long voyages. British naval officers would mix Rose's lime juice with gin or rum to make the citrus intake more palatable for the crew.

The Vodka Gimlet emerged much later, primarily in the late 1970s or early 1980s. This variation gained popularity as vodka's consumption surged in the United States, surpassing bourbon as the most popular spirit by 1975, while gin's popularity waned. Bartenders began substituting vodka for gin to cater to changing tastes and offer a more neutral-flavored alternative to the traditional gin-based cocktail.

Schumann's version, with its precise measurements of lemon juice, lime juice, and vodka, reflects his meticulous approach to cocktail creation, aiming for a perfectly balanced and refreshing drink.
