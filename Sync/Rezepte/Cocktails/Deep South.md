# History
The "Deep South" cocktail is a name applied to various drinks, often inspired by the flavors and cultural essence of the Southern United States. While there isn't a single, universally recognized historical origin for a cocktail specifically named "Deep South," different interpretations exist, aiming to evoke the region's character.

This particular recipe, featuring Lemon Juice, Lime Juice, Dark Rum, Southern Comfort, and Champagne, is a unique interpretation of a "Deep South" cocktail. It combines the citrusy brightness of lemon and lime with the rich, sweet, and fruity notes of Southern Comfort and dark rum, topped with effervescent Champagne. This blend suggests a refreshing and celebratory drink, perhaps reminiscent of Southern hospitality and festive occasions. The inclusion of Southern Comfort, a peach-flavored liqueur with a long history in the American South, directly ties this cocktail to the region's culinary traditions.
