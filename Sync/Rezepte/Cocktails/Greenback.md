# History
The "Greenback cocktail" is a classic American drink with a name that refers to the green color of American paper currency. While its exact origin and inventor are not definitively documented, it is generally believed to have originated in the United States during the late 19th century.

There are a few variations of the Greenback cocktail. This particular recipe, featuring Gin, Green Crème de Menthe, and Lime, is a common rendition. The "green" aspect of its name is directly linked to the vibrant green color imparted by the Crème de Menthe.

The cocktail offers a refreshing and minty profile, balanced by the botanical notes of gin and the tartness of lime. It is a simple yet elegant drink that evokes a sense of classic American mixology.
