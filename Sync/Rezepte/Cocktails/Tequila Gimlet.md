# History
The Tequila Gimlet is a modern adaptation of the classic Gimlet cocktail, where tequila replaces gin as the base spirit. The classic Gimlet itself has a rich history rooted in the British Royal Navy during the 19th century. It was originally conceived as a medicinal drink to combat scurvy, a debilitating disease caused by vitamin C deficiency that was rampant among sailors on long voyages.

Rear-Admiral Sir Thomas Desmond Gimlette, a naval surgeon, is widely credited with creating the drink. He ingeniously mixed gin with lime juice to make the necessary citrus intake more palatable for the sailors. Rose's Lime Cordial also played a crucial role in the traditional recipe and its naval history. The name "Gimlet" itself might derive from Sir Thomas Gimlette's surname or from a small piercing tool used for barrels, referencing the drink's "lively, piercing style."

The Gimlet transitioned from a medicinal necessity to a classic cocktail. The Tequila Gimlet, therefore, is a variation that emerged as bartenders and enthusiasts began experimenting with different spirits in the established Gimlet formula. This recipe, with tequila blanco, lemon juice, and lime juice, is a refreshing and modern take on the classic Gimlet.
