# History
The history of rum eggnog traces back to a medieval British drink called "posset," a warm, milky beverage often curdled with wine or ale and spiced. By the 13th century, eggs were incorporated into some posset recipes. Initially, in Britain, eggnog was considered a drink for the aristocracy because its ingredients—milk, eggs, and spirits like sherry or brandy—were expensive.

The drink made its way to the British colonies in the 18th century. Here, rum, which was readily available and less expensive due to trade with the Caribbean, became a popular substitute for the heavily taxed brandy and wine from Europe. This made eggnog, particularly with rum, accessible and popular across all social classes in America.

Eggnog became firmly associated with the holiday season in the United States during the 1700s. Even the first U.S. President, George Washington, was known to serve an eggnog-like drink that included rum, rye whiskey, and sherry. The term "eggnog" itself is thought to have originated in the American colonies around 1775. This recipe, with white and dark rum, heavy cream, egg white, and simple syrup, is a classic example of this enduring holiday beverage.
