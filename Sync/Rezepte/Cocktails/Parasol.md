# History
The "Parasol" cocktail, as presented in this recipe, is a modern and creative drink that does not have a widely documented historical origin. The name "Parasol" in cocktail culture typically refers to a small, decorative paper umbrella used as a garnish, often associated with tropical and Tiki-themed drinks. The word "parasol" itself means "protection from the sun," evoking a sense of leisure and an idealized tropical setting.

This particular recipe features White Rum, Lime Juice, Banana Liqueur, and Pineapple Juice. This combination creates a vibrant, fruity, and refreshing tropical drink. The white rum provides a clean base, while the lime juice adds a tart citrus note. Banana liqueur and pineapple juice contribute a sweet and exotic tropical flavor profile, making it a delightful and visually appealing cocktail. It embodies the spirit of tropical escapism and enjoyment, much like the decorative parasols often found in such drinks.
