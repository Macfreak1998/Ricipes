# History

The Suffering Bastard cocktail was invented in 1942 by Joe Scialom, a bartender at the Shepheard's Hotel in Cairo, Egypt. Scialom created the drink as a hangover cure for British soldiers stationed in Cairo during World War II.



The original recipe typically included brandy, gin, lime juice (or Rose's lime cordial), Angostura bitters, and ginger beer. There are differing accounts of how the cocktail got its name. Some suggest it was initially called "Suffering Bar Steward" and later misheard as "Suffering Bastard," while others believe Scialom intentionally named it "Suffering Bastard" but used the alternative to avoid causing offense.



After the war, Scialom went on to create variations of the drink, including the "Dying Bastard" (which added bourbon) and the "Dead Bastard" (which further added rum). The Suffering Bastard also became associated with Tiki culture, with Trader Vic developing his own distinct rum-based version of the drink. This recipe, with brandy, gin, lime juice, Angostura bitters, and ginger beer, aligns with the classic proportions of this historically significant cocktail.
