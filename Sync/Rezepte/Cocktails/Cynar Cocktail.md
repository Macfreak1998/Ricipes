# History
The "Cynar Cocktail" is a simple yet elegant drink that highlights Cynar, an Italian bitter liqueur (amaro) whose name derives from its most prominent ingredient: the artichoke (*Cynara scolymus*).

Cynar was first launched in Italy in 1952 by Angelo Dalle Molle, a Venetian businessman (or G.B. Pezziol from Padova in 1950). It gained significant popularity in Italy during the 1960s through memorable television advertisements. The Campari Group acquired the brand in 1996, and it saw a resurgence in popularity in the United States during the craft cocktail movement of the early 2000s.

Cynar is made from a blend of 13 herbs and plants, with artichoke leaves being the key botanical. Despite the artichoke base, its flavor is not overtly vegetal but rather a complex bittersweet profile, offering notes of caramel, toffee, and cinnamon, with a slightly smoky, earthy, and rich character, culminating in a bitter finish. It has a relatively low alcohol content, typically 16.5% ABV.

Cynar is highly versatile and can be enjoyed on its own as an aperitif (before a meal) or a digestif (after a meal), often served neat or over ice with a slice of lemon or orange. This "Cynar Cocktail," combining Cynar with Blanc Vermouth and an orange garnish, is a classic way to enjoy Cynar, emphasizing its bittersweet notes and herbal complexity in a straightforward, aperitif-style preparation. It is a testament to Cynar's versatility as a cocktail ingredient.
