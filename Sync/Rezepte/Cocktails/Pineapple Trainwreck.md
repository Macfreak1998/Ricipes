# History
The Pineapple Trainwreck is a modern tiki-style cocktail created by Ryan Margarian (@ryanmagarianpdx), co-founder of Aviation Gin and one of Portland's most respected bartenders. The drink was featured by Instagram cocktail educator @anatomyofadrink, who noted: "This cocktail is by Ryan Margarian, co-founder of Aviation Gin and one of my favorite Portland places, Oven and Shaker (@ovenandshaker). I ALWAYS have to order this when I go there. It's a banger! The key to this is a high quality spicy ginger syrup. For rum, Margarian prefers Plantation Original Dark and OFTD."

**The Name:**

"Pineapple Trainwreck" suggests both chaos (a trainwreck of flavors) and intensity (like being hit by a train). The name perfectly captures tiki culture's love of dramatic, over-the-top nomenclature. Despite the chaotic name, the drink is carefully balanced.

**Rum Selection:**

The specific rum recommendations are crucial:
- **Plantation Original Dark**: A blended aged rum from Barbados with notes of vanilla, banana, and caramel
- **OFTD (Old Fashioned Traditional Dark)**: Plantation's overproof rum at 69% ABV, a blend of Jamaican, Guyanese, and Barbadian rums with intense funk and spice

The combination of aged rum (for depth and sweetness) and overproof rum (for power and funkiness) is classic tiki technique, following in the footsteps of Don the Beachcomber and Trader Vic.

**The Ginger Emphasis:**

The creator specifically notes that "a high quality spicy ginger syrup" is key. Ginger syrup isn't just for sweetness—it provides warming spice that complements both the rum's complexity and pineapple's tropical sweetness. Quality ginger syrup should have pronounced ginger bite, not just ginger flavor.

**Dual Bitters:**

Using both Angostura (baking spice, cinnamon) and Peychaud's (anise, cherry, floral) adds complexity that single bitters cannot achieve. This layering of flavors is characteristic of sophisticated tiki drinks.

**Portland Cocktail Culture:**

As an Oven and Shaker signature, this drink represents Portland's distinctive approach to cocktails—serious about technique and quality but not overly precious, accessible yet complex, perfect for the city's casual-but-crafty culture.

The Pineapple Trainwreck demonstrates that modern tiki drinks can be both powerfully flavorful and carefully balanced, proving that "trainwreck" doesn't have to mean poorly made—sometimes it just means "deliciously intense."
