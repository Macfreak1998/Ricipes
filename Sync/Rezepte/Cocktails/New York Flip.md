# History
The "New York Flip cocktail" is a specific variation within the classic "Flip" cocktail family.

The "Flip cocktail" has a rich history, originating in England in the late 17th century. Initially, it was a sailor's drink, described as a mixture of beer, rum, and sugar. The drink was traditionally heated with a red-hot iron poker, which caused it to froth and "flip," caramelizing the ingredients in the process. Over time, the flip evolved. When it crossed the Atlantic to America, eggs were introduced into the recipe, replacing the beer, and the drink transitioned from being served hot to cold. By the mid-19th century, the flip was codified in Jerry Thomas's influential 1862 "How to Mix Drinks; or, The Bon-Vivant's Companion," which featured various hot and cold flip recipes. Today, a flip cocktail is generally understood as a drink containing a whole egg (or just the yolk), sugar, and a spirit or fortified wine, distinguished from eggnog by the absence of milk or cream.

The "New York Flip" typically incorporates cream and egg yolk (often without the white), and commonly features Bourbon and tawny Port. This particular rendition is considered a "signature version" from New Yorkers, with the inclusion of cream and egg yolk being described as a "brash" characteristic. This recipe features Egg White, Simple Syrup, Heavy Cream, Bourbon, and Tawny Port, creating a rich, creamy, and complex drink.
