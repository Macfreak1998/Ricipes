# History
The "Tomate" cocktail, also known as Pastis Grenadine, originated in the south of France as a way to diversify the consumption of pastis, an emblematic aniseed-flavored liqueur. It has since become a classic French aperitif, appreciated for its simplicity and refreshing taste.

The cocktail gets its name "Tomate" (French for "tomato") from the vibrant red color created by the addition of grenadine syrup. Grenadine, with its sweet and fruity pomegranate flavor, mellows the intense anise notes of the pastis, making the drink more approachable.

To prepare a Tomate, pastis (such as Pernod, which is a brand of pastis), grenadine syrup, and chilled water are combined. Traditionally, the pastis and grenadine are poured into a glass, and iced water is served separately, allowing the drinker to dilute it to their preference. This recipe, with Pernod and grenadine, is a classic example of this simple and refreshing French aperitif.
