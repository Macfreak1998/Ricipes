# History
The Belsazar Rosé & Tonic is a simple and refreshing long drink that highlights the flavors of Belsazar Rosé vermouth. The history of this drink is therefore closely tied to the history of the Belsazar brand.

Belsazar is a German vermouth brand that was launched in 2013 by Maximilian Wagner and Sebastian Brack in Berlin. Their goal was to create a high-quality, modern vermouth that could be enjoyed on its own or in simple mixed drinks.

The Belsazar Rosé is made from Pinot Noir grapes from the Baden region of Germany and is infused with a variety of botanicals, including wormwood, pink grapefruit, orange blossoms, and raspberries. This gives it a fruity and slightly bitter flavor profile that pairs well with tonic water. The drink has become a popular aperitif, especially in Germany. In 2018, the Belsazar brand was acquired by Diageo.
