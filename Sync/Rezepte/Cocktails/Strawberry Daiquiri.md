# History
The Strawberry Daiquiri, a popular and vibrant cocktail, evolved from the classic Daiquiri, which originated in the late 19th century in Cuba. The classic Daiquiri was named after a beach and an iron mine near Santiago de Cuba.

The invention of the original Daiquiri is widely attributed to Jennings Cox, an American mining engineer working in Cuba around the time of the Spanish-American War in 1898. Legend has it that Cox ran out of gin while entertaining guests and, to appease their palates, mixed local rum with lime juice and sugar, creating the first Daiquiri. The traditional recipe for a Daiquiri consists of rum, lime juice, and sugar, shaken over ice.

The addition of strawberries to this classic recipe came from creative bartenders who sought to enhance its flavor and appeal. The strawberries provided natural sweetness and a distinctive color, transforming it into a favored summer drink. The Daiquiri's popularity grew in the United States after U.S. Navy medical officer Lucius Johnson introduced the drink to Washington D.C. in the early 1900s. The frozen Daiquiri, especially the strawberry version, became particularly popular in the 1940s and 1950s with the advent of blenders. This recipe, with white rum, lime juice, simple syrup, raspberry syrup, and cherries, prepared in a blender, is a classic example of this popular fruity variation.
