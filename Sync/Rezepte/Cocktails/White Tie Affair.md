# History
The White Tie Affair is a modern craft cocktail created by @anatomyofadrink (based in Portland, Oregon) with the evocative description: "My kind of affair: stirred, not shaken... Spirit forward with gin was my first love and it still is. This cocktail is elegant, balanced, and a perfectly named."

**The Name:**

"White Tie" refers to the most formal dress code in Western culture—more formal than black tie, requiring tailcoats and white bow ties. The name positions this as an elegant, sophisticated cocktail worthy of the most refined occasions. The "stirred, not shaken" reference playfully corrects James Bond's famous but technically incorrect Martini preference.

**The White/Bianco Theme:**

Every ingredient except gin has a "white" or "clear" quality:
- **Blanc/Bianco Vermouth**: White/clear vermouth (like Dolin Blanc or Martini Bianco)
- **Bitter Bianco**: Clear bitter liqueur (like Luxardo Bitter Bianco or Suze)
- **Absinthe**: Clear or pale green
- **Maraschino Liqueur**: Clear cherry liqueur

This creates visual elegance—a crystal-clear cocktail that looks simple but contains complex flavors.

**Flavor Architecture:**

- **Gin** (1.5 oz): Botanical base, providing juniper and herbal complexity
- **Blanc Vermouth** (1 oz): Adds white wine character, herbs, and slight sweetness
- **Bitter Bianco** (0.75 oz): Provides gentle bitterness without the orange intensity of Campari
- **Absinthe** (1 tsp): Adds anise/licorice complexity and aromatic depth
- **Maraschino Liqueur** (1 tsp): Contributes cherry-almond sweetness and rounds out flavors

**The Martini Connection:**

The White Tie Affair is essentially a highly sophisticated Martini variation. Like a Martini, it's gin and vermouth based, stirred, and served up. But the additions of bitter bianco, absinthe, and maraschino transform it into something more complex and aromatic.

**Spirit-Forward Elegance:**

The bartender's note about "spirit forward with gin was my first love" reflects a preference for cocktails where the base spirit shines rather than being masked. This approach defines classic cocktail culture—showcasing quality spirits through proper dilution, chilling, and complementary ingredients rather than overwhelming them.

The White Tie Affair represents modern craft cocktail sophistication: taking the Martini template and elevating it through carefully chosen modifiers that add complexity while maintaining the elegant, spirit-forward character that makes Martinis timeless.
