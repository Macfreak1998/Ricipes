# History
The Southern Comfort Sour is a variation of the classic Whiskey Sour, with its history intertwined with the creation and evolution of Southern Comfort liqueur. Southern Comfort was invented in 1874 by bartender Martin Wilkes Heron in New Orleans, Louisiana. Heron aimed to create a smoother, easier-to-drink alternative to the harsh whiskeys of the time. He achieved this by blending bourbon with fruits like cherry, orange, and lemon, along with spices such as cinnamon and a touch of honey.

Initially called "Cuffs & Buttons," the drink gained popularity and was later renamed Southern Comfort, a tribute to its Southern origins. Heron patented his concoction in 1889 in Memphis.

While the exact origin date for the "Southern Comfort Sour" is not pinpointed, it's understood to be a natural adaptation of the traditional Whiskey Sour. The Whiskey Sour, a well-established cocktail, typically combines whiskey, lemon juice, and a sweetener. The "Southern Comfort Sour" simply substitutes Southern Comfort for the whiskey, leveraging the liqueur's inherent fruit and spice notes to create a distinct flavor profile. This recipe, with Southern Comfort, lemon juice, orange juice, and a cherry garnish, is a classic example of this flavorful variation.
