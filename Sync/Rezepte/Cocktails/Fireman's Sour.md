# History
The "Fireman's Sour" is a refreshing cocktail with a history dating back to the early 20th century. It likely originated in the early 1900s, a period when grenadine was gaining popularity in mixed drinks. Its first known mention is in Hugo Ensslin's "Recipe's for Mixed Drinks," published in 1917. The exact inventor of the cocktail is not known.

The cocktail is a tribute to firefighters worldwide. Its vibrant red color is symbolic of fire trucks and the courage associated with firefighters. The "sour" aspect of the drink is said to represent the challenging nature of the work firefighters undertake. It is frequently served at firefighter-themed events and fundraisers.

The Fireman's Sour is characterized by a balance of sweet and tart flavors. It typically combines light rum, tart lime juice, and sweet grenadine. This particular recipe features Lime Juice, Powdered Sugar, Grenadine, White Rum, and Dark Rum, creating a balanced and flavorful drink.
