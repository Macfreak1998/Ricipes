# History
The "Punch à la Washington Hotel" is a cocktail that, despite its classic-sounding name, appears to be a more modern creation rather than a historical drink from the era of George Washington. While various historical punches were enjoyed in early America, this specific recipe is a distinct creation.

Recipes for the "Punch à la Washington Hotel" typically include dark rum, white rum, passion fruit syrup, passion fruit juice, and lime juice. One source indicates that this particular cocktail was first prepared in 1986. However, specific details regarding the creator or the exact "Washington Hotel" where it originated are not readily available.

The name likely evokes a sense of classic elegance and tradition, perhaps inspired by the many historic hotels named "Washington." This punch is a tropical and fruity concoction, perfect for a refreshing drink.
