# History
The "Martinez" cocktail is a classic drink widely considered the direct precursor to the modern Martini, representing a significant step in the evolution of 19th-century cocktail culture. It is revered by cocktail historians and bartenders as a "living artifact" that showcases the balance and flavors of pre-Prohibition drinks.

The exact origin of the Martinez is debated, but its first appearance in print was in the late 1800s. Recipes for the Martinez first appeared in O.H. Byron's 1884 "Modern Bartender's Guide" and Jerry Thomas's 1887 "Bartender's Guide." One popular account suggests that bartender Jerry Thomas created the drink at the Occidental Hotel, possibly for a traveler heading to Martinez, California, and named it after the city. Another theory posits that the cocktail was named after the city of Martinez, California, or was created by a bartender named Richelieue in a saloon there around 1870.

The original Martinez cocktail typically combined Old Tom gin (a sweeter, richer gin), sweet vermouth, maraschino liqueur, and orange bitters, often garnished with a lemon twist. Some early variations also included curaçao or Boker's Bitters. Over time, the name "Martinez" is thought to have evolved into "Martini," with the recipe also shifting, particularly with the move from sweeter Old Tom gin to drier London Dry gin.

This particular recipe features Old Tom Gin, Sweet Vermouth, Maraschino Liqueur, and Orange Bitters, creating a classic and aromatic cocktail that showcases the historical roots of the Martini.
