# History
The "Vodka Bull" and "Vodka Mate" cocktails have distinct histories, both emerging from the trend of mixing vodka with popular caffeinated beverages.

**Vodka Bull (Vodka Red Bull)**
The Vodka Bull, also known as Vodka Red Bull, is a caffeinated alcoholic drink combining vodka with the energy drink Red Bull. While Red Bull itself has been used as a mixer in alcoholic beverages in Europe since the 1980s, the specific combination with vodka gained widespread recognition later. The invention of the Vodka Red Bull cocktail is widely attributed to futurologist Benjamin Reed in 1999. It quickly became popular among young adults in parties and clubs.

**Vodka Mate**
The exact origins of the "Vodka Mate" cocktail are less clear, but it is understood to have emerged in the 1990s. This long drink gained popularity after the caffeinated refreshment drink Mate became widely known. It is also referred to as "Turbo Mate" and is particularly popular in trendy clubs. Club-Mate, a specific carbonated mate-extract beverage from Germany, has a significant following, and Vodka-Mate is a known mixed drink using Club-Mate.

This recipe, combining vodka and Red Bull, is a classic example of the "Vodka Bull" cocktail, a simple yet popular highball.
