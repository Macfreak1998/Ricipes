# History
The "French Martini," despite its name, is a modern cocktail that originated in New York City in the late 1980s. It is widely attributed to bartender Keith McNally, who worked at Balthazar, or to Dale DeGroff, who added it to the menus of McNally's establishments like Pravda and Balthazar.

The "French" in its name is primarily due to the inclusion of Chambord, a black raspberry liqueur that has been produced in France's Loire Valley since 1685. The naming also served a marketing purpose in the 1990s, when cocktails were often given exotic or geographic identifiers to convey sophistication and elegance.

The French Martini was conceived as a sweet and fruity variation of the classic Martini. Unlike a traditional Martini, which typically contains gin or vodka and vermouth, the French Martini is made with vodka, Chambord (or other black raspberry liqueur), and pineapple juice. This combination gives it a distinct sweet and fruity flavor profile and an appealing pink hue, contributing to its rapid global popularity. It is often enjoyed as an aperitif before dinner or as a digestif afterward.
