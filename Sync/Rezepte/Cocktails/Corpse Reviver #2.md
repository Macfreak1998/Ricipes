# History
The "Corpse Reviver #2" is a classic cocktail with a rich history, primarily known for its intended purpose as a "pick-me-up" or hangover cure.

The name "Corpse Reviver" refers to a family of pre-Prohibition cocktails designed to "revive" a person, essentially to cure hangovers, increase vigor, or improve one's morning after a night of overindulgence. The concept of "Corpse Reviver" drinks can be traced back to at least the 1870s, with an early mention in an 1861 English satirical magazine. The first known recipe for a "Corpse Reviver" appeared in *The Gentleman's Table Guide* in 1871.

The "Corpse Reviver #2" specifically gained widespread recognition and popularity through Harry Craddock, a renowned bartender at London's Savoy Hotel. Craddock included the recipe for this cocktail in his seminal *The Savoy Cocktail Book*, first published in 1930. Like many Prohibition-era cocktails, the Corpse Reviver #2 faded from popularity for several decades but experienced a significant resurgence during the craft cocktail movement of the 2000s, as bartenders sought inspiration from historical recipes.

The classic recipe for the Corpse Reviver #2 typically consists of equal parts Gin, Lillet Blanc (or Cocchi Americano, as a substitute for the original Kina Lillet), orange liqueur (such as Cointreau or triple sec), and fresh lemon juice. Additionally, the drink is prepared with an absinthe rinse for the glass, which imparts an aromatic hint without overwhelming the palate.

Harry Craddock famously issued a warning about the potency of the drink in his book: "Four of these taken in swift succession will un-revive the corpse again."
