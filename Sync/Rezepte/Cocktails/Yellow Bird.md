# History

The Yellow Bird cocktail is a classic tropical drink with a somewhat unclear but fascinating history, widely believed to have originated in the Caribbean, particularly in Jamaica or the Bahamas. It gained significant popularity in the 1950s and 1960s, becoming a staple at tropical resorts and tiki bars.



The exact inspiration for its name is debated, with two main theories:

*   **Haitian Song:** Many believe the cocktail was named after a popular Haitian song of the same name, which also had an American rendition. This connection adds to its tropical allure.

*   **Galliano Liqueur:** Another theory suggests the name comes from the bright yellow color imparted by Galliano, a key ingredient in the drink.



The core ingredients of the Yellow Bird cocktail typically include rum (often white rum), Galliano, triple sec, and lime juice. This combination creates a refreshing and fruity taste, making it a favorite for beach settings and tropical vacations. An early reference to a Yellow Bird cocktail recipe, featuring Galliano, white rum, triple sec, and lime juice, appeared in The Palm Beach Post in 1972. This recipe, with white rum, Galliano, triple sec, and lime juice, aligns perfectly with the standard and IBA-listed recipe for the Yellow Bird cocktail.
