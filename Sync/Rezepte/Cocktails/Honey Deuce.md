# History
The "Honey Deuce" is the signature cocktail of the US Open tennis tournament. It was created in 2006 by restaurateur and Grey Goose brand ambassador Nick Mautone. Grey Goose, a sponsor of the US Open, commissioned Mautone to develop a signature cocktail that would be refreshing, visually appealing, and easy to prepare in large quantities.

Mautone's inspiration for the cocktail's unique garnish came when he noticed honeydew melon balls he was scooping for a dessert resembled tennis balls. This observation led to both the distinctive melon ball garnish and the punny name.

Since its debut, the Honey Deuce has become as iconic to the US Open as the Mint Julep is to the Kentucky Derby or the Pimm's Cup to Wimbledon. It has become a cultural symbol of the event, with hundreds of thousands sold each year, generating millions in revenue.

The name "Honey Deuce" is a clever play on words. "Honey" comes from the honeydew melon used for the garnish, and "Deuce" is a tennis term for a tied score of 40-40. The honeydew melon balls are specifically cut to resemble green tennis balls, further reinforcing the tennis theme.
