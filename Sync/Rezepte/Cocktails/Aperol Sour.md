# History
The Aperol Sour is a modern cocktail that puts a twist on the classic "sour" formula. While the drink itself doesn't have a long and storied history, its key ingredient, Aperol, has been around since 1919. Created by the Barbieri brothers in Padua, Italy, Aperol is a vibrant orange aperitif with a unique bittersweet flavor derived from ingredients like gentian, rhubarb, and cinchona.

The Aperol Sour is essentially an experiment in applying the "sour treatment" to Aperol, blending it with lemon juice, simple syrup, and often an egg white or foamer for a smooth, frothy texture. This combination creates a refreshing and well-balanced cocktail that has been growing in popularity in recent years. While its exact origins are unknown, recipes for the Aperol Sour started appearing in cocktail books and online in the early 2010s.
