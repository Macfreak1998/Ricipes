# History
The "Champagne Cocktail" is a classic alcoholic drink with a rich history, originating in the mid-19th century during the evolution of American mixology. Its first published recipe appeared in "Professor" Jerry Thomas's *Bon Vivant's Companion* in 1862, one of the earliest and most influential cocktail books.

Initially, early recipes for the Champagne Cocktail, including Thomas's original, did not feature brandy. The addition of brandy or cognac became more common later in the 19th century, with some attributing its popularization to bartender John Dougherty, who reportedly won a New York cocktail competition with his brandy-enhanced version in 1889.

The Champagne Cocktail quickly became a symbol of luxury and sophistication, favored by aristocrats and frequently ordered at high society gatherings. It was even mentioned in Mark Twain's 1894 novel *Pudd'nhead Wilson*, solidifying its association with indulgence. The drink maintained its popularity through the late 19th and early 20th centuries, experiencing a resurgence during the Prohibition era as speakeasies sought to offer refined beverages. By the 1950s and 1960s, it had become a favorite in Hollywood, appearing in films like *Casablanca* and *An Affair to Remember*, further cementing its glamorous image.

Today, the Champagne Cocktail remains a staple for celebrations and upscale events, embodying elegance and a balance of effervescence, sweetness, and aromatic complexity. It typically consists of a sugar cube, Angostura bitters, Champagne, and often brandy, garnished with a maraschino cherry or a twist of lemon peel.
