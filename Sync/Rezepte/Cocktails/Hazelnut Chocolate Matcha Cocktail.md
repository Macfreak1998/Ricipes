# History
The "Hazelnut Chocolate Matcha Cocktail" is a modern beverage creation, with its inspiration dating back to around 2017. It was conceived by a blogger who was inspired by the prevalence of matcha-flavored candies, particularly Matcha Kit Kats, and blended matcha drinks found in coffee shops.

The cocktail combines the flavors of hazelnut, chocolate, and matcha, aiming to provide a drink with "nutty goodness, chocolate richness and that earthy I-feel-like-I'm-doing-something-good-for-myself-but-am-still-having-a-cocktail-ness tastiness of matcha."

While matcha itself has a rich history dating back nearly a thousand years to China and its popularization in Japan through Zen Buddhism and the traditional tea ceremony, the cocktail is a contemporary adaptation, reflecting the modern trend of incorporating matcha into various food and drink items. There is no deep historical or traditional meaning associated with the "Hazelnut Chocolate Matcha Cocktail" beyond its recreational purpose as a flavorful alcoholic beverage.
