# History
The "Florida Sling" cocktail is a modern interpretation of the classic "Sling" cocktail, likely named to evoke the sunny and tropical essence of the Florida region. While the general "Sling" has a rich history, there is no widely documented historical cocktail specifically named the "Florida Sling."

The "Sling" is an ancient cocktail, first recorded in Maryland in 1778, and is considered one of the earliest forms of mixed alcoholic beverages of American origin. It typically consists of a spirit, sugar, and water, and was popular throughout the 18th and 19th centuries. The name "sling" likely comes from the act of "slinging one back," or possibly from the German word "schlingen," meaning "to swallow fast." Historically, slings were simple concoctions, often served in a tall glass and diluted with water. The addition of bitters to a sling created what was known as a "bittered sling," which is considered a direct precursor to the modern cocktail, particularly the Old Fashioned.

This particular recipe for a "Florida Sling," featuring Lemon Juice, Powdered Sugar, Grenadine, Pineapple Juice, Gin, and Cherry Brandy, combines the refreshing elements of a classic sling with fruity and botanical notes. The inclusion of pineapple juice and cherry brandy adds a tropical and sweet dimension, while gin provides a botanical backbone. It is a vibrant and flavorful drink, perfect for a warm climate.
