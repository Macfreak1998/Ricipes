# History
The Yellow Bird cocktail is a classic tropical drink with origins believed to be in the Caribbean, particularly Jamaica or the Bahamas. It rose to popularity in the 1950s and 1960s, becoming a common offering at tropical resorts and tiki bars.

The exact inspiration for its name is debated. One popular theory suggests it was named after a well-known Haitian song titled "Yellow Bird." Another possibility is that the name refers to the bright yellow color imparted by one of its key ingredients, Galliano liqueur, which is often found in the standard recipe.

The standard recipe for a Yellow Bird cocktail typically includes rum, Galliano, triple sec, and lime juice. However, this "Yellow Bird No 1" recipe, with lime juice, orange juice, coffee liqueur, white rum, and dark rum, is a distinct variation. It deviates from the traditional use of Galliano and triple sec, instead incorporating coffee liqueur, which adds a unique depth and flavor profile to the tropical rum base. This suggests it is a specific interpretation or a different cocktail altogether that shares the "Yellow Bird" name, possibly a modern creation or a regional adaptation.
