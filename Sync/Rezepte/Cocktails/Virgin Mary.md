# History
The Virgin Mary cocktail is essentially a non-alcoholic version of the popular Bloody Mary. Its history is therefore closely tied to the origins and evolution of the Bloody Mary.

The genesis of a non-alcoholic tomato-based drink can be traced back to an "Oyster Cocktail," which was described as a concoction for "those who may be possessed of suicidal intentions." This drink included seven small oysters, Tabasco, lemon, horseradish, various chili sauces, black pepper, and was topped with tomato juice.

The alcoholic Bloody Mary itself has a somewhat disputed origin, with two main figures often credited:
*   **Fernand "Pete" Petiot:** Many sources credit Petiot with inventing the Bloody Mary in the early 1920s while working at Harry's New York Bar in Paris. He reportedly mixed Russian vodka with canned tomato juice. Petiot later refined the drink in 1934, adding salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper, Worcestershire sauce, and lemon juice.
*   **George Jessel:** The comedian and actor George Jessel also claimed to have invented the Bloody Mary in 1927 in Palm Beach, Florida, mixing vodka, tomato juice, and seasoning as a hangover cure.

The Virgin Mary, as a distinct non-alcoholic cocktail, emerged as an alternative to the Bloody Mary, offering the same savory and spicy flavor profile without the vodka. It is typically prepared with tomato juice, Worcestershire sauce, Tabasco, and other spices, often garnished with celery and a lemon or lime wedge. This recipe, with tomato juice, lemon juice, celery salt, Worcestershire sauce, pepper, Tabasco, and a celery stalk, is a classic example of this popular non-alcoholic cocktail.
