# History
The Brain Damage is a layered shot that gets its name from its unusual and slightly unsettling appearance. When made correctly, the ingredients curdle and separate in a way that resembles a brain hemorrhage.

The shot is typically made with peach schnapps, Baileys Irish Cream, and a few drops of grenadine. The grenadine sinks to the bottom and then rises through the other ingredients, creating the signature "bloody" effect. It's a novelty drink that became popular in the 1980s and 1990s, known more for its shocking name and appearance than for its taste. There are several variations, such as the "Alien Brain Hemorrhage," which adds blue curaçao to the mix.
