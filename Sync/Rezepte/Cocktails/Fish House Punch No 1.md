# History
"Fish House Punch" is a historic and potent rum-based cocktail with a rich history rooted in colonial America. It is considered one of the oldest clubhouse cocktails in the United States.

The punch is believed to have originated in 1732 at Philadelphia's State in Schuylkill fishing club, also known as the "fish house." This club holds the distinction of being the oldest fishing club in the United States. The earliest written account of the punch dates back to 1744, when a Virginia official described being served a substantial "Bowl of fine Lemon Punch" at the Schuylkill River. The "fish house" itself was a gentlemen's club where members engaged in activities like fishing, enjoying cigars, and drinking.

A popular anecdote suggests that George Washington, after consuming Fish House Punch at the State in Schuylkill, was unable to make entries in his diary for three consecutive days, highlighting the drink's potency. Another account posits that the punch was created in 1848 to commemorate the first time women were permitted into the "fish house" for a Christmas party. The recipe for Fish House Punch was later documented and published in 1862 by Jerry Thomas, often referred to as the father of American mixology.

Fish House Punch is characterized by its strength and its primary ingredients: rum, cognac, and peach brandy (or peach schnapps). These are typically combined with sugar, water, and lemon juice. The punch is traditionally served in a large bowl with a substantial ice block and garnished with lemon slices. Due to its potency, it is sometimes diluted with cold lemonade, black tea, or seltzer water. This particular recipe features water, brown sugar, dark rum, brandy, Southern Comfort, and lime, and can be served hot or cold.
