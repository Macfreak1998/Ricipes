# History
The "Jacky Old Fashioned" is a specific variation of the classic Old Fashioned cocktail, made with Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey. The Old Fashioned is one of the oldest known cocktails, with its origins dating back to the early 19th century. It is a simple and timeless combination of a spirit, sugar, bitters, and water.

The name "Old Fashioned" emerged in the late 19th century when patrons of bars, who were tired of the increasingly complex new cocktails, would ask for a drink made in the "old-fashioned way."

This version of the recipe specifically calls for Jack Daniel's, a Tennessee whiskey with a distinct flavor profile that comes from its unique charcoal mellowing process. While the classic Old Fashioned can be made with any type of whiskey, the use of Jack Daniel's gives this version a specific and recognizable taste. The note in the recipe that it also "works with proper whiskey" is a playful jab at the sometimes-controversial status of Jack Daniel's among whiskey purists.
