# History
The Strawberry Caipirinha is a popular and fruity variation of the classic Caipirinha, the national cocktail of Brazil. The original Caipirinha, made with cachaça, lime, and sugar, has a history that dates back to the early 20th century, when it was believed to have been created as a remedy for the Spanish flu.

The Strawberry Caipirinha is part of a category of Caipirinha variations known as "Caipifrutas," which use a variety of fruits in addition to or instead of lime. These fruity versions of the classic cocktail have become increasingly popular in Brazil and around the world. The Strawberry Caipirinha is a simple and delicious twist on the original, adding the sweet and vibrant flavor of fresh strawberries to the mix.
