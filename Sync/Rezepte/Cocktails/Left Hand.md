# History
The "Left Hand cocktail" is a modern classic with a rich backstory, combining elements of established drinks and drawing inspiration from a notable figure.

The Left Hand cocktail was created in 2007 (or 2008, according to some sources) by acclaimed bartender Sam Ross while he was working at the Milk & Honey bar in New York City. Ross is also credited with inventing other popular contemporary cocktails, such as the Paper Plane and the Penicillin.

Sam Ross himself described the Left Hand as "a love child between a Negroni and a Manhattaccordingly." It is essentially a variation of the classic Negroni, where gin is replaced with bourbon, and chocolate bitters are added to the mix.

The name "Left Hand" is a tribute to Benjamin "Lefty" Ruggiero, a real-life member of a crime family whose story was famously depicted in the 1997 movie "Donnie Brasco." Ruggiero earned his nickname because he would toss dice left-handed when gambling. The cocktail's composition, which blends Italian ingredients (Campari and sweet vermouth) with American ingredients (bourbon and chocolate bitters), is also said to reflect this narrative.

The Left Hand is part of a series of "Hand" cocktails developed at Milk & Honey, which also includes variations like the Right Hand, Tres Hands, and Smoking Hand. The typical recipe for a Left Hand cocktail includes bourbon, sweet vermouth, Campari, and chocolate bitters, usually garnished with a cherry. It is prepared by stirring the ingredients with ice and then straining them into a chilled cocktail glass. The addition of chocolate bitters is a key differentiator, often compared to a Boulevardier, which shares a similar profile but lacks the bitters.
