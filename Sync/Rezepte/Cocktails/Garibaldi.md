# History
The Garibaldi is a classic Italian aperitivo cocktail named after Giuseppe Garibaldi (1807-1882), one of Italy's greatest national heroes and a central figure in Italian unification. The drink's simple composition - Campari and fresh orange juice - reflects the Italian philosophy of aperitivo culture: simple, refreshing, and designed to stimulate the appetite before a meal.

The cocktail became internationally recognized when it was added to the IBA (International Bartenders Association) official cocktail list in 2024 as part of the Contemporary Classics category. Despite its recent IBA recognition, the Garibaldi has been a staple of Italian bars for decades.

The drink is particularly popular in Italy during the aperitivo hour (typically 6-9 PM), when Italians gather at bars for pre-dinner drinks and light snacks. The bright orange color of the cocktail is said to evoke the "orange shirts" worn by Garibaldi's volunteer army during the Italian unification.

Modern variations often emphasize the quality and preparation of the orange juice. Some bartenders, notably Dante in New York City, have popularized a "fluffy" version where fresh orange juice is aggressively aerated to create a lighter, almost mousse-like texture that enhances the drinking experience.

The Garibaldi represents Italian cocktail culture at its finest: unpretentious, flavorful, and perfect for socializing.
