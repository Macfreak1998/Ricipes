# History
The "Eastside" cocktail is a refreshing gin-based drink known for its bright and herbaceous flavors, incorporating cucumber and mint. It is considered a modern twist on the classic Gin Gimlet and a variation of the Southside cocktail.

The Eastside cocktail was created in 2004 by bartender George Delgado at a New York City bar called Libation. The drink's name is believed to be a nod to its origin in New York City's Lower East Side.

Initially, Delgado's recipe was a "long drink" served with ice and club soda. However, Christy Pope, a bartender at the renowned Milk & Honey bar in New York City, is credited with popularizing a "straight-up" version, served without ice in a chilled coupe glass, which is the most common way to enjoy the cocktail today. The creation of the Eastside was notably inspired by Hendrick's Gin, which had launched in 1999 and featured distinct cucumber and rose notes, complementing the cocktail's key ingredients.

The Eastside cocktail is essentially a contemporary interpretation of the Gimlet, distinguished by the addition of muddled cucumber and fresh mint. Its meaning lies in its refreshing and light profile, making it a popular choice for various occasions.
