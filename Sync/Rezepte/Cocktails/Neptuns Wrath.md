# History
The "Neptune's Wrath" cocktail is a modern classic that originated around 2007 at The Violet Hour in Chicago, created by Toby Maloney.

The name and visual aspects of the cocktail are inspired by the Roman god of the sea, Neptune, expressing his fury. The drink's foaming surface, the green hue from the absinthe, and the flaming Green Chartreuse are all meant to evoke the imagery of a dangerously rough and angry sea.

It is described as a complex gin sour with prominent herbal and anise notes, primarily from the absinthe and Green Chartreuse. The cocktail typically includes gin, absinthe, fresh lemon juice, simple syrup, and half an egg white, finished with flaming Green Chartreuse. This particular recipe features Gin, Absinthe, Lemon Juice, Simple Syrup, Egg White, and Green Chartreuse, creating a visually striking and complex drink.
