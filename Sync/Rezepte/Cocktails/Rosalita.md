# History
The Rosalita cocktail is a modern creation, developed in 2015 by Dylan O'Brien at his bar, Prizefighter, in Emeryville, California. The cocktail is named after a Bruce Springsteen song, adding a touch of rock and roll flair to its identity.

It is a sophisticated variation of the classic lime Margarita, substituting the traditional orange liqueur with Amaro Montenegro. This swap introduces a complex, bittersweet herbal note that distinguishes it from a standard Margarita. The recipe for the Rosalita cocktail was adapted from Robert Simonson's book, "Mezcal + Tequila Cocktails: Mixed Drinks for the Golden Age of Agave."

Key ingredients typically include Tequila (often Reposado), lime juice, agave syrup, Amaro Montenegro, and a salt rim, creating a balanced and intriguing tequila-based drink. This recipe, with tequila, Amaro Montenegro, lime juice, and agave syrup, aligns with O'Brien's original creation.
