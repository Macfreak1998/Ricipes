# History
The "Affogato Martini" is a dessert cocktail inspired by the traditional Italian dessert, affogato al caffè, which translates to "drowned in coffee." This modern cocktail combines coffee liqueur, espresso, and a spirit (commonly aged rum or vodka), finished with a scoop of gelato or ice cream. It's celebrated as both a pick-me-up and an indulgent treat.

The original affogato dessert is believed to have originated in Northern Italy, likely after the espresso machine was invented in the 1950s, though its precise origins are unknown. The Affogato Martini cocktail, however, was introduced at Maialino in New York City. Patrick Smith, Manager of of Bar Openings at Union Square Hospitality Group, sought to transform the classic Espresso Martini into a more dessert-like experience by incorporating gelato.

This cocktail represents an evolution of the Espresso Martini. While the latter typically uses vodka, the Affogato Martini often features aged rum, which imparts additional warmth and depth, though vodka-based versions are also popular. Its appealing presentation and harmonious blend of flavors have contributed to its rising popularity in upscale bars and on social media.
