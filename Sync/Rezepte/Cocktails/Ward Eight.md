# History
The Ward Eight cocktail originated in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1898 at the bar of the Locke-Ober restaurant. It is widely believed to have been created to celebrate the election of Martin M. Lomasney, a powerful Democratic political figure, to a seat in the state legislature. The drink was named after the city's Ward 8, which historically provided Lomasney with a winning margin.

While the most common story attributes its creation to bartender Tom Hussion at Locke-Ober, other accounts suggest different bartenders or even Lomasney's Puritan Club as the origin. Regardless of the exact creator, the Ward Eight quickly became Boston's signature cocktail.

The cocktail is essentially a variation of a Whiskey Sour, with rye whiskey as its base. Early recipes often called for rye whiskey, lemon juice, orange juice, and grenadine. During Prohibition, the Santa Clara Company even trademarked "Ward 8" as a product containing "Compounds of Whisky, Grenadine-Syrup, Rock-Candy Syrup, and Lime-Juice." After Prohibition, Locke-Ober reopened, using a recipe with 2 ounces of rye whiskey, 1/2 ounce fresh lemon juice, and 1/2 ounce fresh orange juice. This recipe, with bourbon, lemon juice, simple syrup, and grenadine, is a classic example of this historically significant cocktail.
