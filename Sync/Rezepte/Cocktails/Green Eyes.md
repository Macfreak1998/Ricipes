# History
The "Green Eyes" cocktail has at least two distinct origins and recipes. This particular version, featuring Gin, Green Chartreuse, Lime Juice, Simple Syrup, and Egg White, was created around 2015 by Andrew Volk at the Portland Hunt & Alpine Club in Portland, Maine, USA. It is considered a variation or "riff" on the classic "Last Word" cocktail.

The name "Green Eyes" primarily refers to the vibrant green color imparted by the Green Chartreuse liqueur, a key ingredient in the drink. The cocktail is known for its rich, herbal flavor balanced with the tartness of lime. The inclusion of egg white provides a silky texture and a frothy head, enhancing the drink's visual appeal and mouthfeel.

It is worth noting that another cocktail named "Green Eyes" was created in California in 1983 and was named the official cocktail of the Los Angeles Olympics in 1984. This version typically included gold rum, Midori (Japanese melon liqueur), coconut cream, fresh lime juice, and fresh pineapple juice. However, the gin and Green Chartreuse version by Andrew Volk is a distinct and modern creation.
