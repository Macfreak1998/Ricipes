# History
The "Agave Julep" is a modern variation of the classic Mint Julep, a cocktail with a rich history rooted in medicinal origins and Southern American culture. The term "julep" itself has ancient roots, derived from the Persian word "gulab," meaning "rosewater." Historically, juleps were medicinal concoctions, often sweet drinks containing herbs, spices, and sometimes spirits, used to make medicine more palatable.

In early America, juleps evolved into sweet, mint-infused drinks. As bourbon production grew in Kentucky, it became the preferred spirit, solidifying the Mint Julep's association with the American South and becoming the official drink of the Kentucky Derby in 1938.

The "Agave Julep" emerges as a contemporary twist on this classic. The primary difference lies in the sweetener: instead of traditional sugar or simple syrup, agave nectar is used. This substitution can be driven by a desire for a different flavor profile, a perceived healthier alternative, or to complement agave-based spirits. Some "Agave Julep" recipes also replace bourbon with tequila or mezcal, further leaning into the agave theme. Therefore, while the "Agave Julep" doesn't possess its own centuries-old history, it is a direct descendant of the Mint Julep, carrying forward the tradition of a refreshing, herb-infused, spirit-based drink, but with a modern adaptation in its sweetening agent and sometimes its base spirit. The "meaning" of a julep, as a sweet and refreshing drink, continues in the Agave Julep, offering a contemporary interpretation of a historical cocktail.
