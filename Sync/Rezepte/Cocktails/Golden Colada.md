# History
The "Golden Colada" is a vibrant and rich variation of the classic "Piña Colada," blending traditional Caribbean flavors with additional ingredients that contribute to its "golden" hue and complex taste. While "Golden Colada" is not a historically recognized cocktail with a distinct origin, it is a creative interpretation that builds upon the well-documented history of the Piña Colada.

The name "Piña Colada" literally translates from Spanish as "strained pineapple," referring to the freshly pressed and strained pineapple juice used in its preparation. This iconic cocktail is typically made with rum, cream of coconut, and pineapple juice, often served blended or shaken with ice. Its origin is widely believed to be in Puerto Rico, though the exact creator is a subject of debate, with Ramón "Monchito" Marrero (1954 at Caribe Hilton) and Ramón Portas Mingot (1963 at Barrachina Restaurant) being the most prominent claimants. In 1978, the Piña Colada was officially declared Puerto Rico's national drink.

This "Golden Colada" recipe features Heavy Cream, Coconut Cream, Pineapple Juice, Orange Juice, Galliano, White Rum, and Dark Rum. The addition of orange juice and Galliano liqueur contributes to its golden color and adds layers of citrus and herbal sweetness, creating a more complex and indulgent tropical drink. It is a testament to the versatility of the Piña Colada template, allowing for creative adaptations that enhance its flavor and visual appeal.
