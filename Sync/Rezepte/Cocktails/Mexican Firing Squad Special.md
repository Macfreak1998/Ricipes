# History
The "Mexican Firing Squad Special" cocktail has a rich history, with its origins traced back to Mexico City in the 1930s.

The cocktail was first documented by the historian and travel writer Charles H. Baker in his 1939 guide, *Gentleman's Companion*. Baker claimed to have discovered the drink in 1937 at the La Cucaracha Cocktail Club in Mexico City. During the Prohibition era in the U.S., Mexico City bars like La Cucaracha thrived, offering creative concoctions to expats and travelers. The La Cucaracha Club was known for its sophisticated atmosphere.

The original recipe, as recorded by Baker, included tequila, the juice of two small limes, one and a half to two teaspoons of grenadine or plain gomme syrup, and two dashes of Angostura bitters. Contemporary versions of the cocktail often call for a bit more grenadine, resulting in a sweeter drink, and some modern iterations may also include a splash of club soda for effervescence. Blanco tequila is typically recommended as it blends seamlessly with the citrusy flavors.

The exact meaning behind the dramatic name "Mexican Firing Squad" is not definitively known. Some speculate that the name alludes to the drink's bold, "in-your-face" flavors, suggesting a powerful and immediate impact, "like a shot that hits you all at once." Others believe the name, with its association with firepower, hints at the cocktail's bold and spicy notes. Despite the intriguing name, the drink is described as a refreshing and balanced blend of sweet, tart, and spicy notes.
