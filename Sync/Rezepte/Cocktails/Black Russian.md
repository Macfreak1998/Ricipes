# History
The "Black Russian" cocktail originated in 1949 and is attributed to Gustave Tops, a Belgian bartender at the Hotel Metropole in Brussels. He created the drink to honor Perle Mesta, who was the United States Ambassador to Luxembourg at the time.

The name "Black Russian" has a dual meaning:
*   **"Russian"** refers to vodka, a spirit traditionally associated with Russia, which is a primary ingredient in the cocktail.
*   **"Black"** denotes the dark color of the coffee liqueur, another key component.

Additionally, some interpretations suggest that the name, particularly the "black" and "Russian" elements, evoked the mysterious atmosphere of the nascent Cold War era in 1949.

The cocktail itself is straightforward, made with just vodka and coffee liqueur. It is the precursor to the "White Russian," which is a variation that includes cream or milk.
