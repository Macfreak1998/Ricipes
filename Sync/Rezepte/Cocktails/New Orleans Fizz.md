# History
The "New Orleans Fizz," also famously known as the "Ramos Fizz," is an iconic cocktail with a rich history deeply intertwined with New Orleans culture. It was created by Henry C. Ramos in 1888 at his Imperial Cabinet Saloon in New Orleans, Louisiana.

Henry C. Ramos developed the cocktail in 1888, initially calling it the "New Orleans Fizz." It quickly gained immense popularity in New Orleans, becoming a signature drink of the city. The drink's fame was such that Ramos often employed numerous "shaker boys" (sometimes up to 20 or even 35 during Mardi Gras) whose sole job was to continuously shake the cocktails to meet demand. The strenuous shaking, often lasting 7-12 minutes per drink, was crucial for achieving its characteristic frothy, meringue-like consistency.

Ramos was known for his strict adherence to quality and his dislike of drunkenness, ensuring patrons enjoyed the drink without overindulging. Despite his success, Ramos closed his saloon and retired at the onset of Prohibition in 1919, famously stating, "I've sold my last gin fizz." Before his death in 1928, he shared his closely guarded recipe with a reporter.

After Prohibition, the cocktail experienced a resurgence in popularity. In 1935, The Fairmont Hotel (now The Roosevelt Hotel) in New Orleans purchased the rights to the Ramos Gin Fizz, trademarking the drink and further promoting it. Louisiana Governor Huey P. Long was a notable admirer of the Ramos Fizz, even bringing a bartender from the Roosevelt Hotel to New York to ensure he could enjoy the drink during his travels.

The "Ramos Fizz" (or "New Orleans Fizz") is more than just a cocktail; it embodies several aspects:
*   **New Orleans Heritage:** It's deeply intertwined with the city's vibrant cocktail culture, known for its elaborate preparations and sensory experiences.
*   **Dedication to Craft:** The extensive shaking required highlights a commitment to precision and quality in bartending, a tradition that continues to be appreciated.
*   **Unique Texture and Flavor:** The drink is celebrated for its distinctive frothy, creamy texture and a refreshing blend of citrus, gin, and orange blossom water. It's often described as a complex drink with citrusy, sweet, and creamy flavors.
*   **A "Fizz" Cocktail:** As a member of the "fizz" family of cocktails, its defining features include an acidic juice and carbonated water, often with gin or rum as the alcoholic base. The addition of egg white and cream distinguishes the Ramos Fizz from a standard gin fizz, creating its signature frothy head.
