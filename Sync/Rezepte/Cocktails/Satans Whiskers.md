# History

The Satan's Whiskers cocktail first appeared in print in Harry Craddock's *The Savoy Cocktail Book* in 1930. While its exact origin is somewhat debated, many cocktail historians attribute its creation to the Embassy Club in Hollywood, a speakeasy run by Adolph "Eddie" Brandstatter, where it was a signature drink. Other sources suggest Craddock himself developed it at the Savoy Hotel in London as a sophisticated twist on the popular Bronx cocktail.



This Prohibition-era drink emerged during a time when American bartenders, including Craddock, moved overseas, fostering cocktail innovation. The cocktail is notable for having two distinct versions:

*   The "straight" version, which uses Grand Marnier as its orange liqueur.

*   The "curled" version, which substitutes Orange Curaçao.



The classic recipe typically combines equal parts gin, orange juice, dry vermouth, and sweet vermouth, along with a half measure of the chosen orange liqueur and a dash of orange bitters. This recipe, with gin, sweet vermouth, dry vermouth, orange curaçao, orange juice, and orange bitters, aligns with the "curled" version of this intriguing classic. After a decline in popularity following World War II, the Satan's Whiskers cocktail was revived as a lost classic by cocktail enthusiasts and historians in the early 2000s.
