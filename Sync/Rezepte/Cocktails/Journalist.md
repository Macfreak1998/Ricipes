# History
The "Journalist cocktail" is a classic gin-based drink with a history dating back to at least the 1920s. Its recipe first appeared in Harry Craddock's 1930 *The Savoy Cocktail Book*, and it was also featured in "Cocktails" by 'Jimmy,' Late of Ciro's, London (1930) and Harry McElhone's "Barflies and Cocktails" of 1927.

The cocktail is essentially a "perfect" Martini with added elements. In cocktail terminology, "perfect" signifies the use of equal parts sweet and dry vermouth. The drink is characterized by its dry and crisp profile, balanced with complexity and a hint of richness.

The name "Journalist" is thought to be an homage to journalists, who were often perceived as hard-drinking individuals with a particular liking for gin, seeking a robust drink to relax after demanding work. Some interpretations suggest that the cocktail's ingredients metaphorically represent aspects of journalism: the lemon for a sharp editorial, gin for the weight and importance of the press, sweet vermouth for the vibrant and lively aspects of news, and dry vermouth for its serious and comprehensive nature. The cocktail is also known by its Spanish equivalent, "Periodista."
