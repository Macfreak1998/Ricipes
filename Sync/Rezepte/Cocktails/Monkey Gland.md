# History
The "Monkey Gland" cocktail, a classic drink from the 1920s, has a peculiar name rooted in a controversial medical practice of its time.

The cocktail was created by Harry MacElhone, the owner of Harry's New York Bar in Paris, France, during the 1920s. This era was marked by experimentation in mixology, and MacElhone is also credited with inventing other well-known cocktails like the Bloody Mary and the White Lady.

The unusual name "Monkey Gland" is a direct reference to the pseudo-scientific work of Dr. Serge Voronoff. Voronoff, a Russian doctor working in France, gained notoriety in the 1920s and 1930s for his procedure of grafting monkey testicle tissue into humans. He believed this procedure could increase longevity and rejuvenate individuals. While his claims were later discredited, the bizarre nature of the practice captured public attention and inspired the cocktail's name. The cocktail's name is considered a "tongue-in-cheek" reference to this medical fad.

The Monkey Gland cocktail typically consists of gin, orange juice, grenadine, and absinthe. Some recipes may substitute absinthe with pastis or Bénédictine. It is known for its distinctive flavor profile, which combines the sweetness of orange with the herbal and slightly bitter notes of absinthe, resulting in a complex and intriguing drink. This particular recipe features Gin, Orange Juice, Grenadine, and Absinthe, creating a vibrant and complex cocktail.
