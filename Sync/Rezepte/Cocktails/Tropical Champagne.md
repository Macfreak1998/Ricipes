# History
The "Tropical Champagne" cocktail, as a specific named drink, originated in 1980, attributed to the renowned German bartender Charles Schumann and documented in his 1991 "American Bar" book.

Beyond this specific creation, the concept of "tropical champagne cocktails" encompasses a broader category of drinks that combine sparkling wine with tropical flavors, often including fruit juices like pineapple, orange, and peach, and sometimes spirits like rum. These variations are frequently suggested for festive occasions, brunches, or as refreshing summer drinks.

Schumann's original recipe features dark rum, passion fruit, orange juice, lemon juice, and Champagne. This recipe, with dark rum, orange juice, passion fruit syrup, lemon juice, and Champagne, aligns with Schumann's creation, offering a vibrant and celebratory cocktail that perfectly blends tropical fruit flavors with the elegance of Champagne.
