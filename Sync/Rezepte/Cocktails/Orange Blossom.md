# History
The "Orange Blossom" cocktail originated during the Prohibition era in the 1900s, primarily to mask the strong taste and smell of the "bathtub gin" prevalent at the time. Bartender Frank Meier of the Waldorf Astoria hotel in New York City is often credited with its creation, naming it after the hotel's signature flower. However, the earliest published recipe resembling a "Blossom" drink dates back to William Schmidt in 1892.

The cocktail's main purpose was to make gin more palatable. The sweet orange juice, and sometimes orange flower water, helped to disguise the harshness of the gin.

There are several variations of the Orange Blossom cocktail. Albert Stevens Crockett's "The Old Waldorf-Astoria Bar Book" from 1935 details two versions: one served neat, combining gin, vermouth, and orange juice, and another served over ice. While some recipes incorporate simple syrup or a liqueur for sweetness, others opt for a more traditional approach using sweet vermouth. It is important to note that the Orange Blossom is distinct from a gin Screwdriver, despite some common misconceptions.

This particular recipe features Gin, Orange Juice, and Orange Flower Water, creating a refreshing and aromatic gin-based drink that highlights the floral and citrus notes.
