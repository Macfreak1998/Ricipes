# History
The "Cucumber Basil Gimlet" is a modern twist on the classic Gimlet cocktail. The original Gimlet originated in the 19th century aboard British Royal Navy ships as a practical measure to combat scurvy. Sailors mixed lime juice (rationed for vitamin C) with gin to make it more palatable.

The name "Gimlet" has two main theories:
*   **Sir Thomas Gimlette:** A Royal Navy surgeon (1879-1913) who recommended adding gin to lime juice.
*   **The Tool:** A small piercing tool, referencing the cocktail's "piercing" or "lively" style.

The classic Gimlet recipe, as per the 1930 *Savoy Cocktail Book*, was typically half gin and half Rose's Lime Cordial. Rose's Lime Cordial, patented in 1867, preserved lime juice with sugar. The cocktail's popularity was boosted by Raymond Chandler's 1953 novel, *The Long Goodbye*.

The "Cucumber Basil Gimlet" is a contemporary evolution, emerging from the modern mixology trend of incorporating fresh, garden-inspired ingredients. The muddled cucumber and fresh basil provide a refreshing, herbaceous, and aromatic twist to the traditional gin and lime base, often described as a vibrant "summer edition."
