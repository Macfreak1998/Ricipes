# History
Lemon squash is a refreshing non-alcoholic drink, essentially a concentrated lemon syrup diluted with water. The term "squash" itself originated from "lemon squash" and refers to a concentrated fruit juice that is mixed with water before consumption.

The origins of lemon squash can be traced back to the colonial era. European settlers in tropical regions developed it as a way to combat the heat and quench their thirst. The drink was first recorded between 1875 and 1880. Over time, lemon squash became a popular staple at social gatherings, picnics, and afternoon teas in various parts of the world, highlighting its cultural significance.

This particular recipe features Lemon or Lime, Simple Syrup, and Water, creating a simple yet effective and refreshing beverage. It is a classic example of a homemade squash, perfect for cooling down on a warm day.
