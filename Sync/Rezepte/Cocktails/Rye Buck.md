# History
The Rye Buck cocktail is part of a broader category of "buck" cocktails, which are characterized by a spirit, citrus juice, and ginger ale or ginger beer. The name "buck" is thought to have come from the "Horse's Neck" cocktail (ginger ale and lemon juice), where the addition of whiskey gave it a "kick," similar to a bucking horse.

The historical roots of the buck cocktail can be traced back to the Mamie Taylor, a drink created in 1899 that featured Scotch whisky, lime juice, and ginger beer. The concept of buck cocktails, including the Rye Buck, saw a resurgence during the Prohibition era around 1920. During this time, ginger ale was a common mixer for illicit alcohol, and rye whiskey was a prevalent spirit, leading to the popularity of the Rye Buck.

This recipe, with rye whiskey, lime juice, ginger syrup, and soda water, is a classic example of a Rye Buck, offering a refreshing and spicy drink that highlights the robust flavor of rye whiskey.
