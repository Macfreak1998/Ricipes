# History
The Rum Alexander cocktail is a variation of the classic Alexander cocktail, which originated in the early 20th century. The original Alexander, first appearing in print around 1914 or 1915, was gin-based. It is widely believed to have been created by Troy Alexander, a bartender at Rector's, a famous New York City restaurant. This initial version combined gin, crème de cacao, and heavy cream, and was possibly created for a dinner celebrating the "Phoebe Snow" advertising campaign, which featured a character in a white dress, thus inspiring a "perfectly white" drink.

Around 1922, the Brandy Alexander variation gained popularity, eventually becoming more famous than its gin-based predecessor. Over time, the Alexander cocktail's versatile formula (base spirit, crème de cacao, and cream) led to numerous adaptations. By the mid-20th century, "pretty much every spirit has been used to make an Alexander," including rum.

Thus, the Rum Alexander is not a cocktail with a singular, well-recorded origin story, but rather a popular adaptation that arose as bartenders and enthusiasts experimented with different spirits in the established Alexander cocktail framework. It follows the same creamy, dessert-like profile as its gin and brandy counterparts, simply utilizing rum as its base spirit. This recipe, with white rum, crème de cacao white, and heavy cream, is a classic example of this enduring dessert cocktail.
