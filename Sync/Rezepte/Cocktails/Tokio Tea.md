# History

The Tokio Tea cocktail, also known as Tokyo Iced Tea, has a somewhat murky and debated history, with no single, definitive origin story or creator. Despite its name, the drink was not invented in Tokyo or Japan.



It is widely considered a variation of the popular Long Island Iced Tea, sharing a similar base of multiple spirits. The key distinguishing ingredient is Midori, a Japanese melon-flavored liqueur, which gives the Tokio Tea its characteristic green color and is the likely inspiration for the "Tokyo" in its name.



Several theories surround its creation, with some believing it was invented in the United States, with its name solely referencing the Japanese origin of Midori. Simon Difford speculates that the cocktail might have originated at TGI Fridays in the 1980s or 1990s, a chain known for its Long Island Iced Tea variations. The European Bartender School suggests it was created for the 1977 film "Saturday Night Fever," though this claim remains unsubstantiated.



The cocktail's popularity has fluctuated, experiencing a decline after its initial emergence, but seeing a recent resurgence. A typical Tokio Tea cocktail includes vodka, rum, gin, tequila, melon liqueur (Midori), sweet and sour mix, and a splash of club soda. This recipe, with gin, white rum, vodka, tequila blanco, Midori, lemon juice, simple syrup, and Sprite, is a classic example of this vibrant and potent cocktail.
