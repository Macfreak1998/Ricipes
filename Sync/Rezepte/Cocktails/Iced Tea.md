# History
The "Iced Tea" cocktail, as presented in this recipe, is a unique and complex variation of the classic Long Island Iced Tea, often referred to simply as "Iced Tea" due to its appearance. This particular rendition is noted as "Schumann's version," suggesting a specific interpretation by a renowned bartender or establishment.

The classic Long Island Iced Tea is a popular cocktail known for its potent blend of spirits and its deceptive appearance, resembling non-alcoholic iced tea due to its amber color from a splash of cola. Despite its name, the traditional Long Island Iced Tea typically contains no actual tea.

There are two primary competing theories regarding the origin of the Long Island Iced Tea:
*   **Prohibition Era (1920s) in Long Island, Tennessee:** One story credits "Old Man Bishop," an alleged illegal liquor distiller from a community called Long Island in Kingsport, Tennessee, who supposedly created a strong alcoholic drink that resembled iced tea to help conceal its true nature.
*   **1970s in Long Island, New York:** A more recent and widely cited origin attributes the cocktail to Robert "Rosebud" Butt, a bartender at the Oak Beach Inn on Long Island, New York, who claims to have invented the drink in 1972.

The traditional Long Island Iced Tea typically includes vodka, tequila, light rum, triple sec, gin, lemon juice, simple syrup, and a splash of cola. This "Schumann's version" of the Iced Tea cocktail deviates by incorporating Brandy and actual cold tea, alongside Lime Juice, Orange Juice, Triple Sec, Dark Rum, and Cola. The addition of brandy adds a layer of rich, fruity complexity, while the cold tea contributes a subtle tannic note and reinforces the "iced tea" illusion. This makes it a sophisticated and flavorful twist on the classic, offering a unique balance of spirits, fruit, and tea.
