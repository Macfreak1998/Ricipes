# History
The history of the Rye Sour cocktail is deeply intertwined with the broader history of sour cocktails and, more specifically, the Whiskey Sour. The concept of sour cocktails originated with sailors who, to combat scurvy, mixed citrus (like limes and lemons) with their spirits, such as rum or brandy. This practice led to early forms of drinks like Grog.

The first known written recipes for sour cocktails appeared in Jerry Thomas's influential 1862 book, *The Bartender's Guide*. While a specific "Rye Sour" wasn't explicitly named in this initial publication, the Whiskey Sour, of which the Rye Sour is a variation, gained prominence. By the early 20th century, rye whiskey was explicitly called for in some Whiskey Sour recipes, demonstrating the use of rye in this cocktail.

The basic components of a sour cocktail—base spirit, citrus, and sweetener—have remained consistent, with the Rye Sour simply utilizing rye whiskey as its base. This recipe, with rye whiskey, lemon juice, simple syrup, and a cherry garnish, is a classic example of this enduring and balanced cocktail.
