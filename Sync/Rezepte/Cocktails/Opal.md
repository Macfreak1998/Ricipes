# History
The "Opal cocktail" refers to at least two distinct drink recipes. The most commonly referenced "Opal Cocktail" is a gin-based drink believed to have originated in the early 20th century, notably appearing in Harry Craddock's 1930 *The Savoy Cocktail Book*.

The cocktail's name likely stems from its "opalescent appearance," which is achieved through the combination of ingredients. This visual effect, known as "louching," naturally occurs when an anise-flavored spirit or liqueur (like Pernod or absinthe) is mixed with water, causing it to turn cloudy.

This particular recipe features Dry Vermouth, Gin, and Pernod. It is a gin-based drink with the addition of Pernod, an anise-flavored spirit, which would contribute to the opalescent appearance when diluted. The combination of gin and vermouth makes it a Martini-style drink, with the Pernod adding a distinctive herbal and anise note, creating a refreshing and intriguing cocktail.
