# History
The "Pimm's Royal" cocktail is a sophisticated variation of the classic "Pimm's Cup," distinguished by its use of Champagne instead of lemonade.

The **Pimm's Cup** is a traditional British cocktail with a rich history, originating in London in the early 19th century. It was invented by James Pimm, who owned an oyster bar, in the early 1840s. Pimm initially created the gin-based concoction as a digestive aid, serving it in a small tankard referred to as the "No. 1 cup," which gave the drink its original name, "Pimm's No. 1 Cup." Its popularity grew rapidly, and it became a quintessential British summer drink, strongly associated with prominent summer sporting and social events like Wimbledon. A classic Pimm's Cup is typically mixed with English-style lemonade and garnished generously with an assortment of fresh fruits and botanicals, such as cucumber, mint, orange slices, lemon, apple, and strawberries.

The "Pimm's Royal" elevates this classic by substituting the lemonade with Champagne, offering a more "chic" and celebratory version of the drink. This particular recipe features Gin, Champagne, Lemon, and Cucumber peel, creating an elegant and effervescent cocktail perfect for special occasions.
