# History
The "Smoke and Bitters" cocktail is a modern drink whose name directly refers to its prominent characteristics: the smoky notes typically derived from mezcal and the bitter elements contributed by ingredients like Fernet Branca and Cynar.

While there isn't a single, definitive origin story for a universally recognized "Smoke and Bitters" cocktail, several interpretations and recipes exist. One popular recipe, often cited by sources like The Educated Barfly and Difford's Guide, includes Fernet Branca, mezcal, Cynar, and tequila blanco. This specific recipe is sometimes attributed as a community recipe by Ben Krapf. The Educated Barfly categorizes it as a "Modern Cocktail."

Another version, featuring Amaro Montenegro, Select Aperitivo, and mezcal, was highlighted by Tad Carducci, an in-house tasting expert for Amaro Montenegro and Select Aperitivo. He described this combination as representing the distinct cultures of Italy and Mexico.

It is important to note that there is also a highly acclaimed bar and smokehouse in Sri Lanka named "Smoke & Bitters," which is a distinct entity from the cocktail recipe itself.
