# History
The "Montana" cocktail does not refer to a single, universally recognized drink with a singular history or origin. Instead, the name has been applied to various cocktail recipes throughout history.

The earliest known documented "Montana Cocktail" recipe appears in Harry Johnson's 1900 edition of "The New and Improved Illustrated Bartenders' Manual." This original version is described as a variation of a Martini, substituting sloe gin for regular gin, and including French vermouth, bitters, and anisette.

Throughout the early 20th century, several different concoctions were referred to by the same name. For example, in 1900, William T. Boothby noted the name was used for bottled Pousse Café. A 1905 Los Angeles Herald article mentioned a makeshift "Montana cocktail" made from eggs, condensed milk, sugar, and medicinal brandy. Jacques Straub's 1913 manual featured a "Montana Cocktail" with brandy, French vermouth, port, bitters, and anisette.

The exact meaning or inspiration behind the name "Montana Cocktail" for Harry Johnson's original recipe is not definitively known. It has been suggested that it could be named after the American state of Montana, a town, or even a person with that surname. In contemporary usage, "Montana cocktail" often refers to drinks that are themed around the state of Montana, rather than a specific historical recipe, frequently incorporating local ingredients or names that evoke the state's character.
