# History
The "Peach Daiquiri" is a modern variation of the classic Daiquiri cocktail, incorporating peach as the primary fruit flavoring.

The **Daiquiri cocktail** originated around 1898 in Cuba, credited to American mining engineer Jennings Cox. The drink was named after Daiquirí, a mining town near Santiago de Cuba. The original recipe, created by Cox, consisted of rum, lime juice, and sugar, offering a refreshing balance of sweet and sour flavors. Its popularity grew in the United States during the 1940s, partly due to the rationing of whiskey and vodka during World War II, making rum a more accessible spirit. Notable figures like Ernest Hemingway and President John F. Kennedy were known to be fans of the Daiquiri. Over time, the Daiquiri evolved, with bartenders experimenting with different variations and ingredients. The addition of fruits like strawberries and bananas became popular, leading to new flavors. The frozen Daiquiri, often made with crushed ice, also emerged as a popular variation.

A Peach Daiquiri is a modern variation of the classic Daiquiri, incorporating peach as the primary fruit flavoring. Its "meaning" is rooted in this evolution, representing a fruity, often frozen, adaptation of the original rum, lime, and sugar cocktail. This particular recipe features Peach, Lime Juice, Simple Syrup, White Rum, and Peach Brandy, creating a vibrant and fruity tropical drink.
