# History
The "Artichoke Hold" cocktail was created in 2019 by Jeremy Oertel at Donna Bar in Brooklyn, New York City.

The name is a clever play on the wrestling term "choke hold," directly referencing Cynar, a key ingredient in the cocktail. Cynar is an Italian bitter aperitif made from artichoke leaves, which contributes to the drink's unique flavor profile. The cocktail is also a variation, or "riff," on Oertel's previous creation, the "Bitter Mai Tai."

The "Artichoke Hold" is characterized by its tropical, bittersweet, and refreshing taste, offering a complex balance of sweet, sour, bitter, and funky notes. The combination of Cynar and elderflower liqueur provides an intriguing bittersweet element, complemented by the robust and funky undertones of Jamaican rum.
