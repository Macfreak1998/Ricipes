# History
The "Gin Fizz" is a classic cocktail with a history that dates back to the mid-18th century, evolving from a therapeutic drink to a globally popular refreshment.

The earliest form of the Gin Fizz emerged around 1750, when Admiral Nelson reportedly mixed gin with lemon to combat scurvy among sailors. This concoction, initially a medicinal remedy, gained popularity among the sailors who later added sugar and soda water, transforming it into a more palatable drink.

The cocktail family known as "fizz" became widely popular in America between 1900 and the 1940s, with the Gin Fizz being a prominent member. It was first formally described in Jerry Thomas's "The Bartender's Guide" in 1876. New Orleans, in particular, became a hub for fizz cocktails, where bars would employ multiple bartenders to keep up with demand due to the extensive shaking required for some variations.

The term "fizz" in the cocktail's name refers to the carbonated water, which gives the drink its characteristic effervescence. The Gin Fizz is known for its light, refreshing flavor and is considered a classic cocktail enjoyed worldwide. Historically, it was even believed to be a hangover cure.

This particular recipe for a Gin Fizz includes Gin, Simple Syrup, Lemon Juice, Egg White, and is topped with Soda Water. The inclusion of egg white makes it a "Silver Fizz" variation, known for its frothy texture.
