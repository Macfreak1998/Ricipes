# History
The "Division Bell" cocktail has a distinct history, origin, and meaning, primarily associated with a mezcal-based concoction created in New York City.

The most recognized "Division Bell" cocktail was created in 2009 by renowned bartender Phil Ward at his New York City bar, Mayahuel. This drink is a modern take, or "riff," on the classic "Last Word" cocktail, but it notably substitutes gin with mezcal and green Chartreuse with Aperol. Phil Ward's creation was significant in introducing mezcal to a broader audience in the United States and demonstrating its versatility beyond traditional margaritas.

The cocktail's name is a direct homage to Pink Floyd's 1994 album, "The Division Bell." Ward reportedly listened to this album repeatedly while he was constructing Mayahuel.

It is worth noting that there is also a mention of another, more recent "Division Bell" cocktail that is inspired by the sound of a division bell, which signals a vote in the UK Parliament. However, the mezcal-based cocktail by Phil Ward is the one with the more widely documented history and impact in the mixology world.
