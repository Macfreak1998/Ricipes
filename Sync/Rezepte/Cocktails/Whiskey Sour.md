# History
The Whiskey Sour cocktail boasts a rich history, with its origins tracing back to the maritime practices of the 18th century. Sailors, facing long voyages and the threat of scurvy due to a lack of Vitamin C, would mix citrus juices with spirits as a preventative measure and to make the often-stale water palatable. This early combination laid the groundwork for the sour cocktail family. Whiskey, being a spirit that didn't require refrigeration, was a popular choice among sailors.

While the concept of combining spirits with citrus and sugar existed for over a century prior, the first recorded mention of a Whiskey Sour in a recipe book appeared in Jerry Thomas's "The Bartender's Guide" in 1862.

As cocktail culture evolved, the Whiskey Sour made its way to the American frontier during the 19th century, gaining popularity amidst a whiskey boom. Bartenders began refining the basic combination of whiskey, citrus, and sugar, leading to a more sophisticated drink.

Over the years, variations of the Whiskey Sour emerged. The addition of egg white to sours dates back to at least 1922. The most famous variation is the New York Sour, which originated around 1870 and features a splash of red wine floated on top. This recipe, with rye whiskey, lemon juice, and simple syrup, is a classic example of this enduring and refreshing cocktail.
