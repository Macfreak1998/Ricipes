# History
The "Honey & Smoke" cocktail is a modern creation that combines the sweetness of honey with smoky spirits, primarily mezcal. It does not have a single, definitive historical origin or a universally recognized meaning beyond its descriptive name.

The broader trend of "smoke cocktails" began to gain traction in the late 2000s, with mixologists exploring ways to infuse smoky flavors into drinks. The popularity of mezcal, a smoky agave spirit, also surged around 2016, contributing to the emergence of cocktails that pair its distinctive smokiness with sweet elements like honey.

The "meaning" of a "Honey & Smoke" cocktail lies in its flavor profile: a sophisticated and often indulgent balance between sweet and smoky notes. Honey is typically used to complement and soften the intense, sometimes harsh, characteristics of smoky spirits, enhancing the overall flavor experience. This particular recipe features Mezcal, Honey Syrup, Lime Juice, and Ginger Beer, creating a refreshing and complex drink that beautifully balances the smoky depth of mezcal with the sweetness of honey and the zing of ginger beer.
