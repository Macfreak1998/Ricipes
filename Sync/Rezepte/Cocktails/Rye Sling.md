# History
The Rye Sling cocktail is rooted in the broader history of "slings," a category of drinks popular in America during the 1700s. Slings were typically composed of a spirit mixed with water and sugar, and could be served either warm or cold. They were stronger than toddies, containing less water, and often included nutmeg.

In the early days of mixed drinks, the spirit used in a sling was not always specific, and gin was a popular choice, but whiskey, including rye whiskey, was also very common. The term "cocktail" itself first appeared in print in 1806, described as a "bittered sling," indicating that bitters were added to the traditional sling ingredients of spirit, water, and sugar.

While there isn't a singular origin for a "Rye Sling" as a distinct named cocktail separate from the general sling category, its history is intertwined with these early American mixed drinks, where rye whiskey was a frequently used base spirit. This recipe, with rye whiskey, lemon juice, simple syrup, Cherry Heering, and soda water, is a modern interpretation that builds upon the classic sling structure, offering a refreshing and balanced drink.
