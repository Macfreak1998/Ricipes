# History
The "Mexicana" cocktail, as presented in this recipe, is a modern and creative drink that does not have a widely documented historical origin. The name "Mexicana" is likely a generic term referring to cocktails originating from Mexico, or a less common variation, designed to evoke the vibrant flavors and spirit of Mexico.

Mexico is renowned for several popular cocktails and traditional beverages, including the Margarita (tequila, lime, triple sec), Paloma (tequila, grapefruit soda, lime), and Michelada (beer, lime, spices). These drinks often feature tequila or mezcal, fresh citrus, and fruity elements, reflecting the country's rich culinary and drinking traditions.

This "Mexicana" recipe features Lemon Juice, Grenadine, Pineapple Juice, and Tequila Blanco. This combination creates a vibrant, fruity, and refreshing tequila-based drink. The tequila blanco provides a clean agave base, while the lemon and pineapple juices contribute a tart and sweet tropical profile. Grenadine adds a touch of sweetness and a beautiful reddish hue, making it a visually appealing and flavorful cocktail that embodies the festive spirit of Mexico.
