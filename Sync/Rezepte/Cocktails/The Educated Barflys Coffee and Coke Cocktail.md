# History
"The Educated Barfly's Coffee and Coke Cocktail" is a modern creation. This specific cocktail, which explicitly combines coffee and Coca-Cola, was developed by Juliana Fisher of The Dewberry bar in Charleston, South Carolina. "The Educated Barfly" featured this recipe on September 19, 2024.

This cocktail is a contemporary take on the concept of coffee-infused drinks, blending rye whiskey, cold brew concentrate, sweet vermouth, Gran Classico, and chocolate bitters, topped with Coca-Cola. It offers a complex flavor profile that balances the richness of coffee and whiskey with bitter and sweet notes, and the effervescence of cola. It stands apart from the much older "Coffee Cocktail," which, despite its name, traditionally contains no actual coffee. This modern creation reflects the ongoing innovation in cocktail development, particularly in incorporating diverse flavors and ingredients.
