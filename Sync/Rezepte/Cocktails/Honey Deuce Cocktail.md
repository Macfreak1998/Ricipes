# History
The "Honey Deuce" cocktail, the signature drink of the US Open tennis tournament, has a distinct history, origin, and meaning.

The Honey Deuce was created in 2006 by restaurateur and Grey Goose brand ambassador Nick Mautone. Grey Goose, a sponsor of the US Open, commissioned Mautone to develop a signature cocktail that would be refreshing, visually appealing, and easy to serve in large quantities to the tournament's attendees. Mautone found his inspiration while preparing a dessert at home, noticing that honeydew melon balls resembled tennis balls. This observation led to the cocktail's distinctive garnish and its punny name.

The name "Honey Deuce" is a clever play on words directly related to its ingredients and the sport it represents. "Honey" refers to the honeydew melon balls used as a garnish, while "Deuce" is a term in tennis for a 40-40 tie score.

The cocktail typically consists of Grey Goose vodka, fresh lemonade, and raspberry liqueur (often Chambord), garnished with skewered honeydew melon balls that mimic tennis balls. Its vibrant pink color, refreshing taste, and thematic garnish have made it an iconic part of the US Open experience, drawing parallels to other famous sporting event cocktails like the Mint Julep at the Kentucky Derby or the Pimm's Cup at Wimbledon. The Honey Deuce has become a cultural symbol of the tournament, known for its visual appeal and its ability to be produced efficiently for large crowds.
