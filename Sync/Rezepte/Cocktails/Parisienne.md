# History
The "Parisienne cocktail," a classic drink with roots in the vibrant Parisian cocktail scene of the 1920s and 1930s, has a distinct history and origin.

The Parisienne cocktail is first documented in the 1929 edition of Harry McElhone's "Harry's ABC of Cocktails." It is believed to have been served at Harry's New York Bar in Paris throughout the 1920s. The original recipe called for equal parts gin, vermouth, and crème de cassis, a blend that was considered unpalatable by some.

In the 1930s, Frank Meier, the head bartender at the Ritz in Paris, amended the recipe by significantly reducing the amount of crème de cassis to just a barspoon. This adjustment likely refined the cocktail's flavor profile.

The name "Parisienne" directly translates to "Parisian woman" or "from Paris," indicating its strong association with the city where it originated and gained popularity. While the search results do not delve into a deeper symbolic meaning, the name itself signifies its French, specifically Parisian, heritage within the world of cocktails.

This particular recipe features Dry Vermouth, Gin, and Crème de Cassis, creating a sophisticated and subtly fruity gin-based drink.
