# History
The "Little Italy" cocktail was created in 2005 by American mixologist Audrey Saunders at the Pegu Club in New York City, a bar she co-owned.

The cocktail is a variation of the classic Manhattan, with its name serving as a tribute to New York City's Little Italy neighborhood, located near the Pegu Club. This naming also reflects a blend of Italian and American influences, acknowledging her Italian clientele.

Saunders' innovation involved replacing the traditional bitters found in a Manhattan with Cynar, an Italian artichoke-based amaro. This substitution imparts more savory and spicy notes to the drink compared to a standard Manhattaccordingly. The creation of the Little Italy cocktail occurred during the early 2000s cocktail renaissance, a period when numerous Manhattan variations, often named after different New York City neighborhoods, gained popularity.
