# History
The non-alcoholic Hurricane, sometimes called a "Virgin Hurricane," is a modern mocktail that captures the tropical flavors of the classic Hurricane cocktail without the alcohol. The original Hurricane was created in the 1940s at Pat O'Brien's bar in New Orleans. The bar owner needed to get rid of a large amount of rum, so he created a potent and fruity cocktail and served it in a distinctive hurricane lamp-shaped glass, which gave the drink its name.

The non-alcoholic version of the Hurricane is a refreshing and family-friendly alternative that has become popular in recent years. It typically combines a variety of fruit juices, such as orange, pineapple, and mango, to create a drink that is both sweet and tart. It's a perfect choice for a hot summer day or for anyone who wants to enjoy a taste of the tropics without the alcohol. The name "Spring Fever" for this version suggests a connection to the vibrant and energetic feeling of the spring season.
