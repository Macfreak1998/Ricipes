# History
The Rolls-Royce cocktail emerged in the early 20th century, a period when cocktails gained popularity within high society. Its name, evoking the luxury of the iconic car brand, was chosen to symbolize elegance and sophisticated living.

The cocktail's first documented appearance was in Harry Craddock's influential 1930 publication, "The Savoy Cocktail Book." Craddock, an American bartender, became a prominent figure at the American Bar in London's Savoy Hotel after Prohibition, where he served a distinguished clientele.

The classic Rolls-Royce cocktail typically features gin, dry vermouth, sweet vermouth, and a dash of Bénédictine. It is characterized as a spirit-forward, complex, and aromatic drink, often described as golden in color, rich on the palate, and highly sophisticated. This recipe, with gin, dry and sweet vermouth, and Bénédictine, aligns with the classic proportions of this elegant cocktail.
