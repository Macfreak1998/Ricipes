# History
The "Peniclin" cocktail is almost certainly a misspelling of the "Penicillin" cocktail, a modern classic created in 2005 by Australian bartender Sam Ross at the renowned Milk & Honey bar in New York City.

Ross drew inspiration from the Gold Rush cocktail and aimed to create a Scotch-based drink with a perceived medicinal, "cure-all" quality, hence the name "Penicillin" (a nod to the famous antibiotic). The cocktail is known for its unique combination of blended Scotch whisky, fresh lemon juice, honey syrup, and a float of smoky Islay single malt Scotch, which gives it a distinctive peaty aroma. The ginger in the recipe further enhances its warming and soothing characteristics.

The Penicillin quickly gained international recognition and has become a staple in craft cocktail bars worldwide, celebrated for its complex yet balanced flavor profile.
