# Spicy Sauvignon Blanc (Jalapeño Sauvignon Blanc)

A simple yet viral sensation, adding a spicy kick to a classic white wine.

## Ingredients
- 1 bottle of Sauvignon Blanc, well-chilled
- 1 fresh jalapeño

## Instructions
1. Slice the fresh jalapeño into thin rounds. Remove the seeds for less heat, or leave them in for more spice.
2. Place the jalapeño slices on a parchment-lined tray or in a freezer bag and freeze them for at least two hours, or until solid.
3. Pour a glass of chilled Sauvignon Blanc.
4. Add a few frozen jalapeño slices to the wine.
5. Let the jalapeño slices sit in the wine for a minute or two to allow the flavor to infuse before sipping. The spice will build as you drink.

## Notes
- Freezing the jalapeños helps to keep the wine chilled without diluting it, and allows the spice to infuse gradually.
- While Sauvignon Blanc is the most common choice, you can also use other crisp white wines or even rosé.

# History
The "Spicy Sauvignon Blanc" is a very recent development in the world of beverages, largely emerging as a social media trend, particularly on platforms like TikTok, around 2023-2025. This trend, often dubbed "Spicy Sauvy B," typically involves adding frozen jalapeño slices directly to a glass of Sauvignon Blanc.

The appeal of this combination is attributed to the pyrazines naturally found in both peppers and Sauvignon Blanc grapes, which contribute green and herbaceous notes, and the capsaicin from the jalapeños adding a spicy kick. More elaborate versions, such as the "Spicy Frozen Sauvignon Blanc" or "Frozignon Blanc," blend the wine with ingredients like agave syrup, lime juice, cucumber, and jalapeño, also gaining traction as a contemporary summer drink.

In essence, while Sauvignon Blanc wine has a rich history spanning centuries, spicy cocktails featuring it are a modern innovation driven by recent culinary trends and social media influence. It's a testament to the ongoing experimentation and creativity in the beverage world.
