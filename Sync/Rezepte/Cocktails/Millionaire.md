# History
The "Millionaire cocktail" is not a single drink but rather a name shared by several distinct cocktail recipes that emerged in the early 20th century, particularly gaining popularity during the Prohibition era in the 1920s. The name itself is thought to reflect the aspirational wealth and prosperity of that period, often referred to as the Roaring Twenties, when many new millionaires were made. The drink is often described as tasting "like a million bucks" or having a rich and luxurious character.

There are two primary historical variations of the Millionaire cocktail:
1.  **The Millionaire No. 1 (Rum-based)**: This vintage cocktail is believed to have been created in the 1800s and was notably published in *The Savoy Cocktail Book* by Harry Craddock in the 1930s. Its traditional ingredients include dark rum, apricot brandy, sloe gin, lime juice, and sometimes a dash of grenadine.
2.  **The Whiskey-based Millionaire**: This version first appeared in Jacques Straub's 1914 *Manual of Mixed Drinks*. Another recipe for a whiskey-based Millionaire cocktail is credited to the London Ritz bar before 1925. This variation typically features rye whiskey (or bourbon), curaçao (or Grand Marnier), raspberry syrup or grenadine, and egg white, with some recipes also incorporating orange bitters, absinthe, or lemon juice.

This particular recipe features Lemon Juice, Egg White, Triple Sec, Grenadine, and Bourbon. It aligns with the whiskey-based Millionaire, offering a rich, fruity, and frothy drink that embodies the luxurious character implied by its name. The inclusion of egg white provides a silky texture and a frothy head, enhancing the drink's appeal.
