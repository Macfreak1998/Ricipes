# History
The "Jean Gabin cocktail" is a warm, comforting drink named after the renowned French actor Jean Gabin, a prominent figure in early 20th-century French cinema. The cocktail's ingredients, which include French spirits, reflect Gabin's French heritage and the country's rich culinary traditions.

The cocktail was created in 1986 by Charles Schumann and is now considered a classic in the cocktail world. It combines dark rum, Calvados (a French apple brandy), maple syrup, and hot milk, often garnished with freshly grated nutmeg. The drink is typically served hot in an Irish glass. Its flavor profile is described as a marriage of the deep warmth of dark rum with the fruity sharpness of Calvados, sweetened gently by maple syrup, and rounded off by warm milk. It is often suggested as a nightcap and pairs well with desserts or savory items like charcuterie.
