# History
The Brombeer Spritz, or Blackberry Spritz, is a modern twist on the classic Italian Spritz. The original Spritz, a mix of wine and sparkling water, has been enjoyed in Italy for over a century. The modern version, with prosecco and a bitter liqueur, has become a worldwide phenomenon.

The Brombeer Spritz is a recent creation that adds the sweet and tart flavor of blackberries to the classic spritz formula. This is typically done with a blackberry liqueur (crème de mûre) or a blackberry syrup. There are many variations of the Blackberry Spritz, with some recipes calling for additional ingredients like gin, vermouth, or different herbs and spices. It's a refreshing and fruity cocktail that has become a popular summer drink.
