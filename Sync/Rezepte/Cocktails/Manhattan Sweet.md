# History
The "Manhattan Sweet" cocktail refers to the traditional preparation of the classic Manhattan cocktail, which specifically uses sweet vermouth.

The Manhattan cocktail, a timeless classic, boasts a rich and somewhat debated history, emerging in the 1860s-1870s in New York City. It is widely regarded as the first "modern cocktail" due to its innovative inclusion of vermouth, a fortified wine, which set a new standard for cocktail creation. One popular, though largely discredited, theory attributes its invention to Iain Marshall at the Manhattan Club in the mid-1870s for a banquet hosted by Lady Randolph Churchill. A more plausible origin points to a bartender named Black, who is said to have invented the drink at his bar on Broadway near Houston Street in the 1860s or 1870s, possibly naming it after his establishment, the Manhattan Inn.

The traditional Manhattan cocktail is made with whiskey (rye is the classic choice, though bourbon, Canadian, or blended whiskey are also used), sweet vermouth, and bitters, typically Angostura. It is prepared by stirring the ingredients with ice, straining them into a chilled cocktail glass, and garnishing with a maraschino cherry.

The "Manhattan Sweet" cocktail, by definition, emphasizes the use of sweet red vermouth, contributing to a richer, slightly sweeter, and more aromatic flavor profile compared to its "dry" or "perfect" counterparts. This particular recipe features Rye Whiskey, Sweet Vermouth, Angostura Bitters, and a Cherry, creating a classic and robust rendition of the Manhattaccordingly.
