# History
The Flamed Orange Old Fashioned is a modern and theatrical twist on the classic Old Fashioned, one of the oldest and most iconic cocktails in history. The Old Fashioned itself dates back to the early 19th century and is a simple and elegant mix of whiskey, sugar, bitters, and water.

The practice of adding an orange to an Old Fashioned became more common during Prohibition, as a way to mask the taste of poor-quality whiskey. However, the technique of flaming an orange peel over the drink is a much more recent innovation, popularized by bartenders in the late 20th century.

Flaming the orange peel releases the citrus oils and creates a smoky, caramelized aroma that adds a new dimension to the classic cocktail. While the effect is largely theatrical, it also adds a subtle complexity to the drink's flavor and aroma. This version of the Old Fashioned is a great example of how modern bartenders are continuing to innovate and put their own spin on classic recipes.
