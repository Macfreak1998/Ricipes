# History
The "French Manhattan" is a variation of the classic Manhattan cocktail, distinguished by its use of cognac or brandy as the base spirit, along with sweet vermouth and orange curaçao or triple sec, and bitters. This gives it a sweeter and smoother profile with an added citrus fragrance compared to a traditional Manhattan, which typically uses rye whiskey or bourbon.

The Manhattan cocktail is considered one of the first "modern cocktails," emerging in the 1860s-1870s. Its exact origin is debated, with several theories:
*   **Manhattan Club Legend:** A popular, though largely discredited, story attributes its invention to Iain Marshall at the Manhattan Club in New York City in December 1874.
*   **George Black's Creation:** Many cocktail historians credit George Black, who owned the Manhattan Inn in the 1860s, with creating the drink.
*   **Hoffman House Bartender:** Another plausible origin points to a bartender named Black at New York's Hoffman House in the 1860s.

The earliest known written mention of a Manhattan-like cocktail appeared in *The Olean Democrat* in 1882. By 1884, recipes for the Manhattan were included in several bartender's manuals.

The name "French Manhattan" signifies a twist on the classic Manhattan, primarily by substituting the traditional American whiskey (rye or bourbon) with a French spirit, cognac or brandy. The addition of orange liqueur further enhances this "French" character, making it a distinct, sweeter, and smoother interpretation of the original.
