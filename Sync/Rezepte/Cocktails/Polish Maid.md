# History
The Polish Maid cocktail is a modern creation that belongs to a family of drinks known as "Maids." This concept is attributed to renowned New York City bartender Sam Ross. The "Maid" cocktails are characterized by a consistent base of muddled cucumber, mint, lime juice, and simple syrup, with the distinguishing factor being the choice of base spirit.

The Polish Maid specifically uses vodka as its base spirit, with the "Polish" in its name referencing the spirit's origin. Other popular variations include the Kentucky Maid (with bourbon) and the London Maid (with gin). These cocktails are a relatively recent addition to the mixology scene, gaining popularity for their refreshing and herbaceous flavor profile. The Polish Maid offers a crisp and clean taste, highlighting the freshness of cucumber and mint with the neutrality of vodka.
