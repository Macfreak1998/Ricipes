# History
The "Remember the Maine" cocktail is a classic drink with a name rooted in a significant historical event. It was first documented in Charles H. Baker Jr.'s 1939 book, *The Gentleman's Companion*, where he recounted enjoying it in Havana, Cuba, during the 1933 Cuban Revolution.

The cocktail's name is a direct reference to the 1898 press slogan, "Remember the Maine, to Hell with Spain!". This rallying cry emerged after the USS Maine battleship mysteriously exploded and sank in Havana Harbor, an incident that played a crucial role in igniting the Spanish-American War.

Often described as a variation of a Manhattan, the "Remember the Maine" is a spirit-driven rye cocktail. Its typical ingredients include rye whiskey, sweet vermouth, Cherry Heering (a cherry-flavored brandy), and a dash of absinthe. This recipe, with rye whiskey, sweet vermouth, Cherry Heering, absinthe, and Angostura bitters, aligns with the classic proportions of this historically significant cocktail.
