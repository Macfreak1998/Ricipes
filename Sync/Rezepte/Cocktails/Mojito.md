# History
The "Mojito" is a renowned Cuban cocktail with a rich history that dates back several centuries. Its origins are somewhat debated, but most accounts trace it to 16th-century Havana, Cuba.

**History and Origin:**
The earliest form of the Mojito is believed to be "El Draque," a medicinal drink named after Sir Francis Drake, the English privateer. In 1586, during his expeditions, Drake's crew reportedly suffered from ailments like scurvy and dysentery. A concoction was created using aguardiente (a crude form of rum), mint leaves, lime juice, and sugar, which was thought to alleviate their symptoms. The lime juice, in particular, would have provided relief from scurvy due to its vitamin C content.

As rum production flourished in Cuba, rum eventually replaced aguardiente as the primary spirit in the drink. The cocktail continued to evolve, gaining popularity among locals and Havana's upper class in the 19th century. The addition of sparkling water and ice further transformed "El Draque" into the refreshing Mojito known today. The Mojito's global recognition significantly increased in the mid-1800s, partly due to the influence of the Bacardi company. Its fame was further cemented by American writer Ernest Hemingway, who was known to enjoy Mojitos at La Bodeguita del Medio in Havana.

The first known recipe for a drink similar to the Mojito, under the name "Mojo Criollo," appeared in a 1927 Cuban publication. The first written recipe explicitly named "Mojito" was published in a 1930 cocktail book sponsored by Bacardi.

**Meaning:**
The exact etymology of the name "Mojito" is a subject of debate. One theory suggests it derives from the African word "mojo," meaning "to place a spell," possibly referencing the drink's perceived medicinal qualities or its association with African slaves working in Cuban sugarcane fields. Another explanation links it to the Spanish word "mojar" (to wet) or "mojadito" (a little wet), describing the refreshing nature of the drink. Additionally, "mojo" is also the name of a traditional Cuban lime-based seasoning, which could be another source for the cocktail's name.
