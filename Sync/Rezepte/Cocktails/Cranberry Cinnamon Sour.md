# History
The Cranberry Cinnamon Sour is a festive cocktail created by Los Angeles-based Instagram bartender @stevenfingar (also known as @intheraw on social media). The drink was specifically designed for the holiday season, with the creator noting: "perfect balance of tart cranberry and warm cinnamon. It's a great sip before Thanksgiving and Christmas (just... maybe steer clear of your white furniture 😬)."

**Holiday Cocktail Design:**

This cocktail embodies everything associated with American fall and winter holidays:
- **Cranberries**: The quintessential Thanksgiving fruit, tart and vibrant red
- **Cinnamon**: Warming spice associated with autumn baking and Christmas
- **Red Color**: Perfect for holiday aesthetics and seasonal gatherings

The humor about white furniture acknowledges cranberry's notorious staining properties—a playful warning that shows the bartender's practical experience with home cocktail making.

**Flavor Architecture:**

The drink balances several key elements:

- **Gin**: Botanical base that doesn't compete with seasonal flavors
- **Cranberry Juice**: Provides tartness and vibrant color
- **Lemon Juice**: Enhances acidity and brightness
- **Cinnamon Syrup**: Adds warming spice and sweetness
- **Egg White/Aquafaba**: Creates silky texture and foam cap

The combination of tart cranberry and warm cinnamon creates a flavor profile that reads as "cozy autumn" rather than "tropical summer," making it perfect for cooler weather.

**Vegan Option:**

The recipe specifically includes aquafaba (chickpea liquid) as an egg white alternative, making this cocktail accessible to vegan guests. Aquafaba performs remarkably similarly to egg whites in cocktails, creating comparable foam and texture.

**Sugared Cranberries:**

The "coated cranberries" garnish refers to cranberries rolled in sugar (sometimes called "jeweled cranberries"), which serve multiple purposes:
- **Visual**: Sparkles beautifully, perfect for Instagram and holiday entertaining
- **Edible**: Guests can eat the garnish
- **Festive**: Looks elegant and seasonal

**Modern Holiday Classic:**

While not a historical classic, this cocktail has become a modern standard for holiday cocktail menus, appearing on numerous bar and restaurant menus during Thanksgiving and Christmas seasons. It represents how contemporary bartenders create "instant traditions" by skillfully combining seasonal ingredients in balanced, appealing ways.

The Cranberry Cinnamon Sour proves that new cocktails can feel traditional when they tap into established seasonal flavor associations and holiday aesthetics.
