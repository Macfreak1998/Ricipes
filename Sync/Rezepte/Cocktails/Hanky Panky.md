# History
The "Hanky Panky" cocktail is a classic drink with a rich history, originating in the early 20th century at the American Bar in London's Savoy Hotel.

The cocktail was created by Ada "Coley" Coleman, who was the head bartender at the Savoy Hotel's American Bar, a position she took in 1903. Coleman was a trailblazing female bartender in a male-dominated profession. She developed the Hanky Panky for Sir Charles Hawtrey, a popular comedic actor and a regular patron of the bar. Hawtrey would often ask Coleman for a drink with "a bit of punch" or "a bit of a kick" to revitalize him after long hours on stage. Coleman spent hours experimenting to create a new cocktail specifically for him.

The Hanky Panky is essentially a variation of a Sweet Martini. It combines dry gin, sweet Italian vermouth, and a crucial secret ingredient: Fernet-Branca. The Fernet-Branca, a bitter Italian digestivo, provides the "punch" or "kick" that Hawtrey desired, giving the cocktail its signature bitter edge and complexity.

According to Coleman's own account, when she presented the new drink to Sir Charles Hawtrey, he tasted it and exclaimed, "By Jove! That is the real hanky-panky!" This reaction gave the cocktail its memorable name. At the time, "hanky panky" meant "trickery" or "magic," rather than its more modern, suggestive connotation. The drink gained wider popularity after it was included in "The Savoy Cocktail Book" by Harry Craddock, who succeeded Ada Coleman as head bartender.
