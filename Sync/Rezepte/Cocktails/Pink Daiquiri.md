# History
The "Pink Daiquiri" cocktail is a refreshing variation of the classic Daiquiri, distinguished by its pink hue, typically achieved through the addition of grenadine or other red fruits.

The **Daiquiri cocktail** originated around 1898 in Cuba, credited to American mining engineer Jennings Cox. The drink was named after Daiquirí, a mining town near Santiago de Cuba. The original recipe, created by Cox, consisted of rum, lime juice, and sugar, offering a refreshing balance of sweet and sour flavors. Its popularity grew in the United States during the 1940s, partly due to the rationing of whiskey and vodka during World War II, making rum a more accessible spirit. Notable figures like Ernest Hemingway and President John F. Kennedy were known to be fans of the Daiquiri. Over time, the Daiquiri evolved, with bartenders experimenting with different variations and ingredients. The addition of fruits like strawberries and bananas became popular, leading to new flavors. The frozen Daiquiri, often made with crushed ice, also emerged as a popular variation.

The "Pink Daiquiri" is a modern variation of the classic Daiquiri, incorporating elements that give it its characteristic color. Its "meaning" is rooted in this evolution, representing a fruity, often visually appealing, adaptation of the original rum, lime, and sugar cocktail. This particular recipe features Lime Juice, Simple Syrup, Grenadine, and White Rum, creating a vibrant and fruity tropical drink with a beautiful pink color.
