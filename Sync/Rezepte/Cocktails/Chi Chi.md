# History
The "Chi Chi" cocktail is a tropical drink that emerged in the early 1970s, often associated with American tiki culture and resort life. It is essentially a variation of the Piña Colada, distinguished by its use of vodka instead of rum.

The exact origin of the Chi Chi cocktail has a couple of attributions. Some sources suggest it was first concocted in the early 1970s at the Chinchilla Room in the Waikiki area of Honolulu. Others credit its origin to Don the Beachcomber, a chain of tiki bar restaurants founded by Donn Beach, a pioneer of mid-century tiki culture. The initial version of the drink was known as the Macadamia Nut Chi Chi and included macadamia nut liqueur, which was later omitted, simplifying it to a three-ingredient cocktail.

The Chi Chi gained popularity by catering to a growing demand for lighter spirits, specifically vodka, offering a neutral spirit alternative to the rum-based Piña Colada. Its creamy, sweet, and tropical flavor profile, combining pineapple, coconut, and vodka, quickly made it a symbol of 1970s and 1980s resort culture, particularly in Hawaiian hotels and bars. The drink evokes a sense of escapism and relaxation, becoming a staple of poolside menus. The name "Chi-Chi" is believed to be a playful derivation, hinting at its status as a slight variation on a classic cocktail.
