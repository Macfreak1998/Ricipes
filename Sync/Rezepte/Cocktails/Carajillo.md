# History
The Carajillo is a traditional Spanish coffee cocktail that emerged circa the 19th century. The drink's origins are debated, but one popular theory suggests it was created by Spanish soldiers in Cuba who added rum to their coffee for extra courage ("corajillo" meaning "little courage") before battle. Over time, the name evolved to "carajillo."

The modern Carajillo is made with just two ingredients: freshly brewed espresso or cold brew coffee and Licor 43 (Cuarenta Y Tres), a Spanish liqueur that's over 1,800 years old. Licor 43 has a distinctive vanilla flavor profile that pairs exceptionally well with coffee, creating a smooth, sweet alternative to the espresso martini.

The cocktail can be prepared in two traditional ways:

**Shakeado (Shaken)**: The modern method where ingredients are shaken with ice and served up in a coupe glass, creating a frothy, chilled cocktail with a beautiful foam top.

**Puesto (Layered)**: The traditional Spanish method where Licor 43 is poured over ice in an Old Fashioned glass, and freshly brewed espresso is slowly poured over the top, creating a visually striking layered effect. The espresso is often floated gently over the back of a spoon to maintain the layers.

The Carajillo gained massive popularity in 2024, with Yelp's Food & Drink Trends report showing searches for Carajillo skyrocketed 118% year-over-year. It became one of the most popular cocktail recipes of the year, particularly among younger demographics discovering alternatives to the espresso martini.

The drink represents Spanish café culture and has become a global phenomenon, appearing in cafés and cocktail bars worldwide. Its simplicity (just two ingredients) and the perfect balance of coffee bitterness with vanilla sweetness make it an accessible yet sophisticated choice for coffee and cocktail lovers alike.
