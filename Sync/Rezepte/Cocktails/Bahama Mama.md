# History
The "Bahama Mama" is a popular tropical rum cocktail with a somewhat debated history, though it is generally believed to have originated in the Bahamas. While some sources suggest its creation during the Prohibition Era in the 1920s or 1930s, most evidence points to the 1950s as its likely origin. The British Colonial Hotel in Nassau played a role in popularizing the drink, featuring it on their menu in 1956. Bahamian bartender Oswald "Slade" Greenslade claimed to have invented the Bahama Mama in the 1960s, though this is disputed as the drink was known earlier.

There are several theories regarding the origin of the "Bahama Mama" name:
*   **Calypso Performer:** The most popular theory is that the cocktail was named after Dorothy "Dottie" Lee Anderson, a famous Caribbean calypso dancer and performer from Nassau who used the stage name "Bahama Mama" in the mid-20th century.
*   **Prohibition Era:** Another theory links the name to the Prohibition Era (1920-1933) in the United States, suggesting it emerged from the Bahamas' role as a base for rum smuggling.
*   **1932 Song:** The phrase "Bahama Mama" also appeared in a song titled "Bahama Mama: That Goombay Tune" released in 1932.

The Bahama Mama is a vibrant, fruity, and tropical rum cocktail. It's often associated with vacation, relaxation, and a taste of paradise, designed to evoke the atmosphere of a tropical beach. It typically combines various rums (light, dark, and coconut), fruit juices like pineapple and orange, and often grenadine or coffee liqueur, resulting in a sweet and refreshing drink.
