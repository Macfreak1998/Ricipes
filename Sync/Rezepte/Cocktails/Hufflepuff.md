# History
The Hufflepuff cocktail is a modern creation inspired by the world of Harry Potter. It is one of many fan-created drinks that pay homage to the four houses of Hogwarts. The cocktail is designed to represent the traits of Hufflepuff house: loyalty, patience, and a love of nature.

There is no single, official recipe for the Hufflepuff cocktail, and many variations exist. However, they all share a common goal: to create a drink that is as warm, welcoming, and good-natured as the members of Hufflepuff house. This version of the cocktail is a simple and refreshing mix of rum, honey, lemon, and ginger beer, with the honey and lemon representing the house's connection to nature and its cheerful disposition. The yellow color of the drink also reflects the Hufflepuff house color.
