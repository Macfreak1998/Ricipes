# History
The "Lemon on the Beach" cocktail, as presented in this recipe, is a modern variation inspired by the popular "Sex on the Beach" cocktail. While there is no widely recognized cocktail by the name "Lemon on the Beach" with a distinct historical origin, it builds upon the vibrant and fruity profile of its predecessor.

The "Sex on the Beach" cocktail is widely believed to have originated in Florida in 1987 during Spring Break. A bartender named Ted Pizio at Confetti's Bar in Fort Lauderdale is often credited with its creation. The drink was concocted as part of a promotional campaign to boost sales of peach schnapps. When asked to name his new creation, Pizio reportedly thought of the two main reasons tourists flocked to Florida: "sex" and "the beach," thus giving the cocktail its memorable and provocative name. The "Sex on the Beach" quickly gained popularity due to its catchy name, colorful appearance, and sweet, refreshing taste, becoming an icon of the 1980s and 1990s.

This "Lemon on the Beach" recipe features Vodka, Peach Liqueur, Orgeat, Grenadine, Lemon Juice, Orange Juice, and Cranberry Juice. It takes the core elements of a "Sex on the Beach" (vodka, peach liqueur, fruit juices) and introduces lemon juice and orgeat, creating a more complex and tart-sweet flavor profile. The "Lemon" in the name highlights this addition, offering a refreshing and fruity twist on the classic beach-themed drink.
