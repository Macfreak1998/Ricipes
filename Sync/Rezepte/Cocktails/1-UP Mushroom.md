# History
The "1-UP Mushroom" is a modern tiki cocktail, drawing its name and inspiration from the iconic "1-Up Mushroom" in video games, particularly the Super Mario Bros. franchise. In gaming, a "1-Up" signifies gaining an extra life, a concept that originated in pinball machines in the 1960s before being popularized by video games in the 1980s. The green mushroom in Super Mario Bros. became a widely recognized symbol for an extra life, and the term "1-Up" is now ingrained in gamer culture.

The cocktail's name is a playful homage to this video game item, evoking the idea of an "extra life" or a gaming-themed drink. This particular recipe is a modern tiki creation, as described by the "How to Drink" YouTube channel.
