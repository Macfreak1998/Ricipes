# History
The "Jean Lafitte cocktail" is a name associated with several different concoctions, all paying homage to the historical figure Jean Lafitte, a French-American pirate and privateer active in the Gulf of Mexico in the early 19th century, notably aiding American forces in the Battle of New Orleans. The meaning behind these cocktails stems from his legendary status and connection to New Orleans.

This particular recipe, featuring Lemon Juice, Egg Yolk, Powdered Sugar, Triple Sec, Gin, and Pernod, is a unique interpretation of a "Jean Lafitte" cocktail. It combines the botanical notes of gin with the citrus of lemon, the sweetness of sugar and triple sec, and the distinctive anise flavor of Pernod. The inclusion of an egg yolk adds a creamy texture, making it a rich and complex drink. While not directly linked to a specific historical recipe from Lafitte's time, this cocktail evokes a sense of adventure and the diverse influences of the Gulf Coast region, much like the legend of Jean Lafitte himself.
