# History
The Russian Spring Punch cocktail was invented in the 1980s by the renowned London bartender Dick Bradsell. Bradsell, a pivotal figure in revitalizing London's cocktail scene, crafted the drink to be refreshing and effervescent, balancing the robust flavor of vodka with vibrant, spring-like notes.

The cocktail's name alludes to the use of Russian vodka and the fresh, invigorating essence of spring. Despite its name, the Russian Spring Punch is a product of British mixology, showcasing the innovative and lively cocktail culture of late 20th-century London. It rose to prominence during the 1980s and 1990s amidst a wider resurgence of interest in crafted cocktails in the city.

According to Bradsell, he initially created the recipe for friends who wished to host a cocktail party economically, providing them with vodka, crème de cassis, simple syrup, and lemon juice, and instructing them to supply their own sparkling wine. The Russian Spring Punch has been recognized by the International Bartenders Association (IBA) since 2011. This recipe, with vodka, crème de cassis, lemon juice, simple syrup, and Champagne, aligns with Bradsell's classic creation.
