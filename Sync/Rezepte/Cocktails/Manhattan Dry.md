# History
The "Manhattan Dry" cocktail is a variation of the classic Manhattan cocktail, distinguished by its use of dry vermouth instead of sweet vermouth.

The Manhattan cocktail, a classic and enduring drink, has a somewhat debated origin story, but its emergence in New York City during the 1860s-1870s is widely accepted. It is often considered the first "modern cocktail" due to its innovative inclusion of vermouth, an aromatized and fortified wine, which distinguished it from earlier whiskey cocktails. One popular, though largely discredited, theory suggests the Manhattan was created by Iain Marshall at the Manhattan Club in the mid-1870s for a banquet hosted by Lady Randolph Churchill. A more plausible origin points to a bartender named Black, who is said to have invented the drink at his bar on Broadway near Houston Street in the 1860s, possibly naming it after his establishment, the Manhattan Inn.

The traditional Manhattan cocktail is made with whiskey (rye is the classic choice, though bourbon, Canadian, or blended whiskey are also used), sweet vermouth, and bitters, typically Angostura. It is prepared by stirring the ingredients with ice, straining them into a chilled cocktail glass, and garnishing with a maraschino cherry.

The "Manhattan Dry cocktail" completely replaces the sweet vermouth with dry vermouth. This substitution results in a less sweet drink that highlights the rich, herbal, and bitter notes of the whiskey and dry vermouth. The terms "wet" and "dry" can also refer to the ratio of whiskey to vermouth in a Manhattan, with more vermouth making it "wetter" and less making it "drier." This particular recipe features Rye Whiskey, Dry Vermouth, and Angostura Bitters, creating a crisp, spirit-forward, and less sweet rendition of the classic Manhattaccordingly.
