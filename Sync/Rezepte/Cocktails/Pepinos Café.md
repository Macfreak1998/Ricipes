# History
The "Pepinos Café cocktail" is a warm, coffee-based alcoholic drink. Its name, while containing "Pepinos" (Spanish for cucumbers), does not actually include cucumber as an ingredient in the common recipe.

The exact historical origin of the "Pepinos Café cocktail" is not widely documented. However, its name can be broken down:
*   **Pepinos:** This is the Spanish word for "cucumbers." The absence of cucumber in the recipe suggests the name might be a playful misnomer, a reference to something else entirely, or perhaps a localized variation where cucumber was once an ingredient or implied.
*   **Café:** This is the Spanish word for "coffee," which is a primary ingredient in the cocktail.

This "Pepinos Café cocktail" typically includes Tequila, Kahlua coffee liqueur, brown sugar (or simple syrup), hot coffee (or espresso), and whipped cream for topping. The preparation involves heating the tequila and Kahlua, stirring in sugar, filling with coffee, and then topping with whipped cream. It offers a comforting and indulgent experience, blending the rich flavors of tequila and coffee with sweetness and creaminess.
