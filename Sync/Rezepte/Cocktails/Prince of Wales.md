# History
The Prince of Wales cocktail was created by Albert Edward, Prince of Wales, who later became King Edward VII. Known for his indulgent lifestyle, he often prepared this drink himself at private events, which helped it gain recognition and prestige in the late 19th century.

One of the earliest recorded recipes appeared in an anonymous 1901 biography, "The Private Life of King Edward VII." The original recipe typically included rye whiskey, crushed ice, a small square of pineapple, a dash of Angostura bitters, a piece of lemon peel, a few drops of Maraschino liqueur, a little champagne, and powdered sugar to taste.

This recipe, with cognac, Bénédictine, Angostura bitters, and champagne, is a variation that reflects the evolution of the cocktail. The drink was considered a symbol of the elegance and indulgence of Britain's aristocratic social scene during the Gilded Age, with its use of refined and sometimes expensive ingredients. While there were other cocktails bearing the "Prince of Wales" name, the one attributed to Albert Edward is considered the most significant.
