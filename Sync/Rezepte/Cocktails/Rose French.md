# History
The "Rose French" cocktail is a variation of the classic "Rose" cocktail, a French drink that gained popularity in Paris from the early 1900s until World War II. It is widely believed to have been created by Giovanni "Johnny" Mitta, the head bartender at the Chatham Bar in Paris, with its first appearance in print dating back to 1910. Mitta's inspiration for the cocktail is thought to have been "La Rose Jacqueminot," a popular perfume of the era.

The original Rose cocktail typically consisted of kirschwasser (a cherry eau de vie), French vermouth, and red currant or strawberry syrup. However, due to its popularity, numerous variations of the recipe emerged over time, with some bartenders incorporating ingredients such as gin.

This recipe, with gin, dry vermouth, Eau-de-vie de Cerises (Kirschwasser), and grenadine, aligns with these variations, offering a gin-based interpretation of the classic French Rose. The cocktail's presence in notable publications like Harry Craddock's 1930 "The Savoy Cocktail Book" further solidified its place in history.
