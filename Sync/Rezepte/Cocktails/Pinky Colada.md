# History
The "Pinky Colada" is a vibrant and fruity variation of the classic Piña Colada. While the original Piña Colada, a blend of rum, pineapple juice, and cream of coconut, has a rich history dating back to Puerto Rico in the 1950s, the Pinky Colada is a more modern adaptation.

The key difference in the Pinky Colada is the addition of grenadine, which gives the drink its characteristic pink hue and a touch of extra sweetness. This variation emerged as bartenders and home mixologists began to experiment with the classic recipe, adding ingredients to enhance its visual appeal and flavor profile. It's a popular choice for those who enjoy the tropical flavors of a Piña Colada but with a fun, colorful twist.
