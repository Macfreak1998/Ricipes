# History
The "Golden Dream" cocktail originated in the 1960s at the Old King Bar in Miami, where it was created by bartender Raimundo Alvarez. The drink gained significant popularity in the late 1960s and 1970s, particularly on the East Coast of the United States and in Hollywood circles.

The cocktail was reportedly dedicated to actress Joan Crawford, symbolizing the glamour and allure of the golden era of cinema. Its name is said to reflect both its smooth, luxurious character and the "dreamy, sun-drenched image of California." The creation of the Golden Dream also coincided with the vibrant and optimistic cultural backdrop of the 1960s, with its mixology reflecting the era's creativity and social revolutions.

Often described as a dessert drink, the Golden Dream is known for its sweet, creamy, and citrusy flavor profile, with hints of vanilla and a taste reminiscent of a Creamsicle. It is typically made with Galliano, Cointreau (or Triple Sec), fresh orange juice, and cream.
