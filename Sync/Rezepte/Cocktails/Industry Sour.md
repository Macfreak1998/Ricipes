# History
The "Industry Sour" cocktail was created in 2011 by bartender Ted Kilgore at Taste in St. Louis.

Ted Kilgore developed the cocktail on a Sunday night for a fellow industry professional. His inspiration was to combine "all of my favorite things into a glass" in an equal-parts scenario. The recipe was first posted on Kindred Cocktails in November 2011.

The name "Industry Sour" plays on the trend of drinks supposedly made for service industry workers. It also subtly appeals to cocktail enthusiasts who appreciate what a "real bartender" might enjoy. The cocktail cleverly balances two ingredients often favored by bartenders, Fernet Branca and Green Chartreuse, which are known for their assertive and intense flavors.

The Industry Sour is characterized by a unique interplay between the medicinal, menthol notes of Fernet Branca and the sweet, vegetal, and herbal notes of Green Chartreuse. Despite the strong individual flavors of its components, the addition of lime juice and simple syrup results in a surprisingly balanced and palatable drink that is herbal, bittersweet, and sour.
