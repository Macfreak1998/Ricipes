# History
The "New Yorker" cocktail, as presented in this recipe, is a modern and creative drink that does not have a widely documented historical origin. The term "New Yorker cocktail" is not associated with a single, commonly recognized drink, but rather refers more broadly to cocktails originating from or popularized in New York City, such as the Manhattan or the New York Sour.

New York City played a significant role in the evolution of cocktails in America, with early bartenders establishing cocktail culture and influencing trends.

This "New Yorker" recipe features Bourbon, Lime, and Grenadine. This combination creates a simple yet flavorful whiskey-based drink. The bourbon provides a robust base, while the lime adds a tart citrus note, and grenadine contributes sweetness and a reddish hue. It is a refreshing and approachable cocktail, offering a straightforward blend of whiskey, citrus, and sweetness.
