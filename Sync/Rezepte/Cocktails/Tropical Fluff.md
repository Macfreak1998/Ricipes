# History
The "Tropical Fluff" cocktail was created by New York City bartender Fanny Chu for Donna, a bar in Brooklyn. The drink is described as a mashup of a Jungle Bird and a Garibaldi, aiming to combine the tropical elements of the former with the low-proof, bitter-orange profile of the latter.

The cocktail's flavor profile is characterized by the "funkiness of the rum," banana notes from the liqueur, a mix of pineapple, orange, and grapefruit juices, and the bitterness of Aperol, which tempers the sweetness and adds complexity. It is often suggested as a brunch drink.
