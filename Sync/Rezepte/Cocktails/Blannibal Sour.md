# History
The "Blannibal Sour" cocktail was created by Miami-based bartender Gabriel Urrutia, inspired by the character Blannibal from "The Eric Andre Show." Blannibal is depicted as a "Frankenstein version" of Hannibal Buress, a co-host on the show, who was "birthed" by Eric Andre after Hannibal quit in season 5, episode 2.

The cocktail's ingredients include Haitian White Rum, Absinthe, Pineapple Juice, Lime Juice, and Blueberry Syrup. The notable inclusion of a significant amount of absinthe is said to reflect the surreal and intense nature of the Blannibal character.
