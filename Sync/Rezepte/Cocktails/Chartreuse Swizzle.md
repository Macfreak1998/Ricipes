# History
The "Chartreuse Swizzle" is a modern classic tiki cocktail created by American bartender Marcovaldo Dionysos in San Francisco. It was devised in 2003 for a Chartreuse-sponsored cocktail competition, where it won first place. Dionysos was working at Harry Denton's Starlight Room at the time and later added the drink to the menu.

The cocktail is made with green Chartreuse, velvet falernum, pineapple juice, and lime juice. Its name comes from the "swizzle" technique, which involves mixing the drink with a swizzle stick, traditionally a branch from a Carib tree called Quararibea turbinata. This technique, dating back to the 18th century, creates a uniform dilution and slightly frothy texture, and is also responsible for the frost that forms on the outside of the glass.

The "Chartreuse" in the name refers to Green Chartreuse, a complex French liqueur made by Carthusian Monks since the 1737 based on a 1605 manuscript for an "elixir to long life." The liqueur's secret recipe, known only to a few monks, involves 130 different plants, herbs, and flowers, giving it its distinctive green color and unique flavor. Dionysos was inspired to combine the then-popular Chartreuse with the less common velvet falernum to create a tropical cocktail, drawing inspiration from other rum-based swizzle drinks. The Chartreuse Swizzle has since been recognized as an official cocktail by the International Bartenders Association since 2024.
