# History
The "Hot Buttered Rum" cocktail has a rich history, originating in Colonial America as far back as the 1600s, evolving from the Hot Toddy. Its rise in popularity is directly linked to the abundance of rum, which became a cornerstone of Colonial America's trade due to molasses imported from the Caribbeaccordingly. Colonists, already accustomed to warm beverages, began experimenting with rum, mixing it with butter and spices to create a comforting drink for chilly winters.

Historically, the drink served as a practical solution for staying warm and utilizing available trade goods during cold seasons. Early Americans even believed rum to be nutritious and a body strengthener. The addition of butter provided richness, calories, and a smooth texture, making it a fortifying beverage. It quickly became a staple at home gatherings and in taverns, fostering community.

The "meaning" of Hot Buttered Rum today largely revolves around its role as an indulgent and comforting winter warmer, especially popular during the fall and holiday season. The cocktail typically consists of rum, butter, hot water or cider, a sweetener like brown sugar or honey, and various spices such as cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves. The drink experienced renewed interest in the 1940s, even appearing as a Tiki drink. National Hot Buttered Rum Day is celebrated every January 17th.
