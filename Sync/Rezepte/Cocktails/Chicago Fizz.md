# History
The "Chicago Fizz" is a classic cocktail with a history rooted in the early 20th century in Chicago. The cocktail emerged around the early 1900s and gained significant popularity during the Prohibition era. Its appeal during Prohibition stemmed from the addition of soda water, which helped to mask the taste of alcohol, making it a favored drink in speakeasies. It was also a popular choice among Chicago's high society. The Chicago Fizz was first documented in Jacques Straub's 1914 book "Drinks." Later, in his 1931 "Old Waldorf Bar Days" book, Albert Stevens Crockett described it as "an importation from the Windy City," acknowledging its Chicago origins. While the cocktail is clearly associated with Chicago, the precise reason for its naming remains somewhat uncertain, though it was common for fizz cocktails to be named after locations.

The term "fizz" in cocktail nomenclature refers to a category of sour drinks. These cocktails are typically shaken, often with an egg white, and then topped with carbonated water or another fizzy ingredient to create a frothy texture. In their heyday during the late 1800s and early 1900s, fizzes were sometimes consumed as breakfast cocktails or as a remedy for hangovers, with the emulsified egg white believed to provide nutrients.

The Chicago Fizz is characterized by its refreshing and citrusy profile, often featuring dark rum, port wine, lemon juice, simple syrup (or sugar), and an egg white, all topped with club soda. The egg white is a key ingredient, contributing to the cocktail's distinctive creamy and frothy texture.
