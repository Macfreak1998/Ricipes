# History
The Spritzer cocktail, commonly known as the Spritz, has a rich history rooted in the Veneto region of Italy during the 1800s, a period when the area was under Habsburg (Austrian) rule. The name "Spritz" itself is derived from the German word "spritzen," meaning "to splash" or "to spray."

The cocktail's origin lies in the custom of Austrian soldiers who found the local Italian wines too potent for their taste. To make the wines lighter and more similar in alcohol content to the beer they were accustomed to, they would dilute them with a "spritz" of soda water.

Over time, the Spritz evolved. Initially, it involved diluting wine with still water, which later transitioned to sparkling water. The wine component eventually shifted to Prosecco, and various bitter liqueurs, known as amari (such as Aperol, Campari, Select, and Cynar), were introduced, adding complexity to the drink.

Today, a modern Spritzer is typically a sparkling wine-based cocktail featuring Prosecco or a dry white wine, a bitter liqueur (though not in this simple version), and soda water. This recipe, with white wine and soda water, represents the most basic and original form of the Spritzer, a refreshing and light drink perfect for any occasion.
