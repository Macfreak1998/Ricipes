# History
The "Gauguin cocktail" is a fruity, tropical drink inspired by the French post-Impressionist artist Eugène Henri Paul Gauguin. Its creation is a homage to Gauguin's life and artistic period spent in the South Pacific, particularly in Tahiti and the Marquesas Islands, where he found significant artistic inspiration.

While the precise historical origin and creator of the cocktail are not widely documented, it is considered a modern concoction that draws its essence from the artist's work. The cocktail's name and flavor profile are intended to evoke the vibrant colors, tropical landscapes, and "primitive" expression characteristic of Gauguin's paintings.

The meaning of the "Gauguin cocktail" is deeply intertwined with Paul Gauguin's artistic legacy. Gauguin was renowned for his experimental use of color, his synthetist style, and his focus on depicting indigenous life and tropical themes. This particular recipe, featuring White Rum, Lime Juice, and Cherimoya, is designed to be a "colorful and bold" representation of the tropical beauty that influenced his art, offering a refreshing, sweet, and tart profile with the unique flavor of cherimoya.
