# History
The "Bellini" cocktail originated in Venice, Italy, and was created by Giuseppe Cipriani, the founder of the legendary Harry's Bar. It was first served in the summer of 1948, though some sources suggest its invention occurred between 1934 and 1948, or specifically in 1947.

The cocktail is made with white peach purée and Prosecco, an Italian sparkling wine. Historically, a small amount of raspberry or cherry juice was sometimes added to enhance its characteristic pink hue.

Cipriani named the drink "Bellini" because its distinctive pinkish-orange color evoked the soft, vibrant tones found in the paintings of Giovanni Bellini, a renowned 15th-century Venetian artist. The drink initially gained fame as a seasonal offering at Harry's Bar and later became a global favorite, symbolizing Italian elegance and hospitality. Today, it is widely recognized as a cocktail consisting of sparkling wine and peach juice or purée.
