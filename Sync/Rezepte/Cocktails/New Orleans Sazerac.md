# History
The "New Orleans Sazerac" cocktail, often simply called the Sazerac, is a drink with deep Creole roots, originating in New Orleans, Louisiana, in the late 1830s. It is often considered one of the oldest American cocktails.

The creation of the Sazerac is widely credited to Antoine Amédée Peychaud, a Creole apothecary who had emigrated to New Orleans. Peychaud would serve a mixture of brandy and his proprietary homemade Peychaud's Bitters to friends. A popular theory suggests that the word "cocktail" itself may have derived from Peychaud serving his concoctions in an egg cup, known as a "coquetier" in French.

The cocktail received its name from Sazerac-de-Forge et Fils, a brand of French cognac that became the primary spirit in the drink. By 1850, the drink gained significant popularity, leading a local bar owner, Sewell T. Taylor, to import this specific cognac. Aaron Bird, who later bought Taylor's bar (renaming it The Sazerac Coffee House), began serving the "Sazerac Cocktail" with the imported cognac and Peychaud's bitters.

The recipe evolved over time. Around 1870, due to the phylloxera epidemic that devastated European vineyards and reduced cognac availability, Thomas Handy, who then owned the Sazerac Coffee House, decided to substitute rye whiskey for the cognac. In 1873, bartender Leon Lamothe introduced absinthe to the cocktail. After absinthe was banned in the United States in 1912, Herbsaint or Pernod became common substitutes.

Today, the Sazerac is traditionally made with either cognac or rye whiskey, absinthe (or a substitute like Pernod), Peychaud's Bitters, and a sugar cube. A distinctive aspect of its preparation involves rinsing a chilled old-fashioned glass with absinthe before straining the other ingredients into it. The Sazerac was officially designated as the official cocktail of New Orleans on June 23, 2008. This particular recipe features a Sugar Cube, Angostura Bitters, Bourbon, and Pernod, creating a classic and robust rendition of the Sazerac.
