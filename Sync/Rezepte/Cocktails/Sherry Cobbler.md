# History
The Sherry Cobbler is one of America's first true cocktails, invented in the early 1820s-1830s. This historic drink popularized two revolutionary bar innovations: the drinking straw and crushed ice.

Created during the golden age of American mixology, the Sherry Cobbler became wildly popular in the mid-19th century, particularly after being featured prominently in Charles Dickens's novel "Martin Chuzzlewit" (1844). The cocktail's refreshing nature and visual appeal made it a favorite among both men and women.

The drink's significance extends beyond its taste - it introduced the concept of "fancy" cocktails with elaborate garnishes and presentation. The use of crushed ice was revolutionary for its time, and the cocktail's popularity led to the widespread adoption of drinking straws in American bars.
