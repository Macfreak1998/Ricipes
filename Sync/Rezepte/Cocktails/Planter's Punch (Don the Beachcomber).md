# History
The Planter's Punch is a classic rum cocktail with a history rooted in the West Indies, likely originating in Jamaica between the late 18th and early 19th centuries. It was a refreshing drink enjoyed by plantation owners and workers, typically made with rum, citrus, and sugar. The drink is famously associated with a rhyming formula: "One of sour, two of sweet, three of strong, and four of weak."

Donn Beach (Ernest Raymond Beaumont Gantt), the pioneer of Tiki culture and founder of the iconic "Don the Beachcomber" bars, played a pivotal role in popularizing and evolving the Planter's Punch. During his rum-running trips to Jamaica during Prohibition, he encountered the drink and was inspired to adapt it.

Donn Beach significantly modified the traditional recipe, creating complex fruit juice mixes for the "sour" component, infusing sugar syrups for the "sweet," and blending multiple rums for the "strong." His 1937 version of the Planter's Punch often featured a blend of rums, Velvet Falernum, and Angostura bitters, with some variations also including grenadine. He also introduced the technique of using crushed ice and an electric mixer to flash blend his drinks, which became a hallmark of his tiki creations. This recipe reflects Don the Beachcomber's influential take on the classic Planter's Punch.
