# History

The Sea Breeze cocktail boasts a history of evolving recipes, with its origins tracing back to the late 1920s or 1930s in the United States. Initially, the cocktail was quite different from its modern iteration. Near the end of the Prohibition era, the Sea Breeze was made with gin and grenadine. By the 1930s, the recipe had shifted to include gin, apricot brandy, grenadine, and lemon juice.



The modern version of the Sea Breeze, which typically contains vodka, cranberry juice, and grapefruit juice, gained popularity later. This shift was significantly influenced by Ocean Spray, a cranberry growers' cooperative formed in the 1930s. Ocean Spray actively promoted cranberry juice as a mixer for alcoholic beverages, initially with gin and later with vodka.



The Sea Breeze is considered a descendant of the Cape Codder (vodka and cranberry juice) and is often grouped with similar drinks like the Bay Breeze (vodka, cranberry, and pineapple juice) and the Greyhound (vodka or gin and grapefruit juice). The drink saw a resurgence in popularity in the 1980s and is recognized as an IBA Official Cocktail. This recipe, with vodka, grapefruit juice, cranberry juice, grenadine, and orgeat, is a classic example of this refreshing and timeless cocktail.
