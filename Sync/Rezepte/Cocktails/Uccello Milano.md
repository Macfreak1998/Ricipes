# History
While there is no widely recognized historical cocktail specifically named "Uccello Milano," the city of Milan has a rich and influential cocktail history, particularly in the realm of aperitivo culture. The name "Uccello" means "bird" in Italian, but this term does not appear in the names of Milan's classic drinks.

This particular recipe, with 7-year-old Havana rum, Ramazzotti, lime juice, lemon juice, simple syrup, and pineapple juice, suggests a modern, tropical-inspired drink with an Italian amaro. It is likely a contemporary creation that draws inspiration from Milan's vibrant cocktail scene and the use of Italian liqueurs like Ramazzotti, which is a classic amaro.

Milan is renowned as the birthplace of several iconic cocktails, such as the Milano-Torino (Mi-To), Americano, and Negroni Sbagliato, all of which have shaped Italian drinking traditions. This "Uccello Milano" cocktail, while not a historical classic, embodies the spirit of innovation and the blending of diverse flavors that characterize modern mixology, possibly as a tribute to Milan's cocktail heritage.
