# History
The "Artlantic" cocktail is a sea-green drink that originated at the Atlantic Bar & Grill in London, England.

This cocktail is prepared with spiced rum, amaretto liqueur, blue curaçao liqueur, lime juice, and apple juice. It is often described as sweet and pleasant.

While its origin is tied to the Atlantic Bar & Grill, the specific meaning or inspiration behind the name "Artlantic" beyond this geographical connection is not explicitly detailed in the available information. However, it is a clear portmanteau of "Art" (perhaps referring to the art of mixology or the visual appeal of the drink) and "Atlantic" (referring to the bar's name and location).
