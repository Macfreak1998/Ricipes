# History
The Campari Spritz is a classic Italian aperitif with a history that dates back to the 19th century. The "spritz" itself was born in the Veneto region of Italy, when Austrian soldiers would dilute the local wines with a "spritz" (splash) of water.

The cocktail evolved over time, and in the 20th century, it became popular to add a bitter liqueur to the mix. Campari, a bitter liqueur invented by Gaspare Campari in 1860, was a natural choice. The Campari Spritz, a combination of Campari, prosecco, and a splash of soda water, became a popular pre-dinner drink throughout Italy.

While the Aperol Spritz has gained more international fame in recent years, the Campari Spritz is considered by many to be the original and more sophisticated version of the drink, with a more complex and bitter flavor profile. It is typically served over ice with a slice of orange.
