# History
The "Paradise" cocktail is a classic "pre-dinner" drink, or apéritif, made with gin, apricot brandy, and orange juice. It is recognized by the International Bartenders Association (IBA) in "The Unforgettables" category.

**Origin and History:**
The Paradise cocktail has been around since at least the 1930s. While often associated with Harry Craddock and his influential "The Savoy Cocktail Book" published in 1930, earlier mentions of a Paradise cocktail exist in writings by Jacques Staub (1913) and Robert Vermeire (1922). The earliest known in-print recipe was written by Harry MacElhone in 1922. Regardless of its precise inventor, the cocktail gained significant popularity in fashionable London circles during the late 1920s and early 1930s due to its inclusion in Craddock's book. It originated in England, like many other historically significant cocktails.

**Meaning and Cultural Significance:**
The name "Paradise" is thought to evoke a "heavenly" sensation when tasting the drink. The cocktail reflects an early 20th-century fascination with more exotic and luxurious ingredients, such as apricot brandy, which became more accessible with improvements in global trade. Its presence in a definitive cocktail book of the era solidified its place in cocktail history as a symbol of sophistication and the allure of the Roaring Twenties.

In popular culture, the Paradise cocktail played a key role in the 1932 film "One Way Passage" and was later popularized by rapper Snoop Dogg in his song "Gin and Juice." Snoop Dogg, along with Warren G and Michael Voltaggio, even set a world record in 2018 for the largest "Gin and Juice," which was a 500-liter Paradise cocktail.
