# History
The "Wedding Bells Cocktail" has a documented origin in Charles Schumann's 1995 book *American Bar*. This version of the cocktail features gin, cherry, and orange flavors.

Another cocktail also named "Wedding Bells" was added to "Drink Guy" on November 30, 2014, and includes rye whiskey, orange liqueur, Lillet Blanc, and orange bitters.

The name "Wedding Bells" itself likely draws inspiration from the broader tradition of "wedding bells," which refers to the ringing of church bells at weddings. This tradition dates back to Celtic lands, where it was believed to ward off evil spirits and announce marriages, symbolizing celebration and new beginnings.

This recipe, with orange juice, gin, sweet vermouth, and cherry brandy, aligns with the version from Charles Schumann's book, offering a celebratory and fruity cocktail. It's a delightful drink that evokes the joyous spirit of a wedding.
