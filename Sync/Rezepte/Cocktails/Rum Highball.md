# History
The history of the Rum Highball is closely tied to the broader history of the Highball cocktail. The Highball, in its general form, originated in England in the 19th century, initially with brandy and sparkling water. It later evolved, with the Scotch and soda becoming a popular variation. The term "Highball" itself appeared in the 1890s, and it typically refers to a mixed alcoholic drink with a base spirit and a larger proportion of a non-alcoholic, often carbonated, mixer, served over ice in a tall glass.

A prominent example of a Rum Highball is the Cuba Libre, also known as Rum and Coke. This cocktail originated in Cuba in the early 1900s, following the Spanish-American War of 1898, coinciding with the first importation of bottled Coca-Cola into Cuba from the United States. The drink's name, "Cuba Libre" (Free Cuba), was a slogan of the Cuban independence movement.

The Rum Highball is a simple and refreshing drink that highlights the flavors of rum with a carbonated mixer like ginger ale, soda water, or Sprite. This recipe, with white or dark rum and a choice of mixer, embodies the classic highball structure.
