# History
The "Gibson" cocktail is a classic mixed drink closely related to the Martini, primarily distinguished by its unique garnish: a pickled cocktail onion. It typically consists of gin and dry vermouth, stirred and served straight up in a cocktail glass.

The exact history and origin of the Gibson cocktail are debated, with several popular theories:
*   **Charles Dana Gibson:** One prominent theory suggests the drink was named after American illustrator Charles Dana Gibson, famous for his "Gibson Girl" illustrations. According to this account, in the late 19th or early 20th century, Gibson challenged a bartender named Charley Connolly at the Players Club in New York to improve upon a Martini. Connolly reportedly replaced the olive with a pickled onion and named the drink after Gibson.
*   **Walter D.K. Gibson:** Another theory, considered more probable by some, credits San Francisco businessman Walter D.K. Gibson. His great-nephew claimed that Walter invented the drink at the Bohemian Club in the 1890s. Anecdotes suggest Walter D.K. Gibson either preferred his Martinis without bitters or used the onion to distinguish his non-alcoholic drink (chilled water) from others during business meetings, or to easily identify his drink during poker games.
*   **Evolution from the Martini:** Historically, the earliest versions of the Gibson cocktail were primarily differentiated from Martinis by the omission of bitters, which were common in Martinis of that era. Early published recipes, such as William Boothby's 1908 "The World's Drinks and How to Mix Them," describe a Gibson without bitters, but did not always specify an onion garnish. The pickled onion eventually became the defining characteristic of the drink.

The meaning of the Gibson cocktail today lies in its savory profile, imparted by the pickled onion, which offers a distinct alternative to the olive or lemon twist found in a traditional Martini.
