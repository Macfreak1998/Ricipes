# History
The "Volcano" cocktail refers to a few distinct drinks, primarily the "Flaming Volcano" (a large, communal tropical drink often served in tiki bars) and the more modern "Under the Volcano" (a tequila-based cocktail). However, the recipe presented here, with black raspberry liqueur, blue curaçao, and champagne, does not align with these widely documented versions.

This suggests that this specific "Volcano" recipe is likely a unique creation or a local variation, possibly inspired by the visual effect of the liqueurs and champagne. The combination of a dark red liqueur (black raspberry) and a vibrant blue liqueur (blue curaçao) in a champagne flute, especially with the option to heat and flame the liqueurs, creates a dramatic and theatrical presentation, reminiscent of a volcanic eruption.

This cocktail likely emerged from the creativity of modern mixologists seeking to create visually stunning and celebratory drinks. It offers a sweet and effervescent experience, perfect for special occasions where a dramatic presentation is desired.
