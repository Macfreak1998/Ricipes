# History
The "Monte Carlo Imperial cocktail" is an elegant and refreshing drink that is an adaptation of a recipe found in Harry Craddock's 1930 "The Savoy Cocktail Book." This gin-based cocktail is described as a classic, minty digestif.

The name "Monte Carlo Imperial" evokes a sense of luxury, sophistication, and European glamour, reminiscent of the famous ward of Monaco. The "Imperial" aspect further emphasizes its refined and elevated character.

This particular recipe features Lemon Juice, Crème de Menthe White, Gin, and Champagne. The combination of gin and crème de menthe creates a crisp, minty, and botanical profile, balanced by the tartness of lemon juice and the effervescence of champagne. It is a sophisticated and celebratory drink, perfect for special occasions or as a refreshing digestif.
