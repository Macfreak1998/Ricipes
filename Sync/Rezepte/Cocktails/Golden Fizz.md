# History
The "Golden Fizz" cocktail is a classic drink with roots in the late 19th century, emerging as a variation of the popular Gin Fizz. It gained significant traction and was particularly favored by high society in the United States during the Prohibition era.

The "Fizz" cocktail family, from which the Golden Fizz originates, evolved from the "Fix" cocktail of the mid-1800s. The key distinction of a "Fizz" is the inclusion of carbonated water, which replaced still water in the earlier "Fix" recipes, making the drink sparkling and more refreshing.

The "Golden" in the cocktail's name directly refers to the addition of an egg yolk. This ingredient imparts a distinctive golden color, a rich, creamy, and frothy texture, and a velvety mouthfeel to the drink. When vigorously shaken, the egg yolk emulsifies with the other ingredients, creating a luxurious, custard-like consistency that beautifully contrasts with the effervescence of the sparkling water.

Historically, the preparation of Golden Fizzes, like other "Fizz" cocktails, involved meticulous techniques such as the "dry shake" (shaking ingredients without ice) followed by a "wet shake" (shaking with ice) to achieve the perfect texture and chill. The Golden Fizz is known for its well-balanced profile, offering a slightly sweet and tangy flavor with citrus notes from lemon juice and botanical undertones from gin. This particular recipe features Gin, Lemon Juice, Egg Yolk, Powdered Sugar, Orange Juice, and Soda Water, creating a vibrant and frothy drink.
