# History
The "Gin Basil Smash" is a modern classic cocktail with a clear origin and a refreshing meaning.

The Gin Basil Smash was created in 2008 by bartender Jörg Meyer, owner of Le Lion – Bar de Paris in Hamburg, Germany. Meyer was inspired by the traditional "smash" cocktail category, particularly the Whiskey Smash, and sought to create a gin-based version. He initially named his creation "Gin Pesto" but later changed it to Gin Basil Smash to better reflect its identity as a cocktail rather than a culinary dish. The cocktail quickly gained international recognition, partly due to its vibrant green color, which made it popular on social media.

The "smash" in Gin Basil Smash refers to a category of cocktails that traditionally involve muddling fresh fruit or herbs with a spirit, citrus, and sugar. The Gin Basil Smash embodies this concept by combining gin, lemon juice, simple syrup, and a generous amount of fresh basil. The result is a cocktail known for its unique, fresh, and herbaceous taste, often described as a modern take on the gin sour with the addition of basil.
