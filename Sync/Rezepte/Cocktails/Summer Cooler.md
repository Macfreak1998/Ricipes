# History
While there isn't a single, historically documented "Summer Cooler" cocktail with a precise origin story that specifically combines orange juice, Angostura bitters, and Sprite, the components align with the broader category of "cooler" drinks and modern cocktail variations.

"Cooler" is a general term for refreshing, often light and cold, mixed drinks that typically include soda water or ginger ale, gaining popularity in the late 1800s. Early examples like the "Saratoga Cooler" (1917) featured lemon, sugar, ginger ale, and sometimes Angostura bitters.

Recipes very similar to this "Summer Cooler" exist, often combining orange juice, Angostura bitters, and a lemon-lime soda like Sprite or 7-Up. This suggests that while not a named classic with a singular inventor, this combination is a common and logical evolution within the tradition of "cooler" cocktails, utilizing readily available ingredients for a refreshing drink. It's a perfect example of a simple, customizable, and invigorating beverage ideal for warm weather.
