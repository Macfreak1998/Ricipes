# History
The Whiskey Hot Toddy, a warm and comforting cocktail, boasts a history steeped in both medicinal claims and social custom, primarily originating in 18th-century Scotland.

The exact origin of the name "Toddy" is debated, with theories pointing to "Tod's Well" in Edinburgh, Scotland, or the Hindi word "taddy" from British-occupied India. Regardless of the precise etymology, the Hot Toddy as we know it today—typically made with whiskey, hot water, honey, and lemon—became popular in Scotland. The addition of honey, lemon, and hot water helped to mellow the often robust and smoky flavor of Scotch whisky, making it more palatable.

Historically, the Hot Toddy was widely regarded as a remedy for colds and other ailments, a perception that continues to this day. An Irish doctor named Robert Bentley Todd is also associated with the drink, as he reportedly prescribed a mixture of hot brandy, cinnamon, and sugar water to his patients. The drink made its way to the American colonies, where it was adapted with locally available spirits like rum and brandy. By the mid-19th century, the Hot Toddy was firmly established as a common cold cure in America. This recipe, with bourbon, lemon juice, simple syrup, lemon, and a cinnamon stick, is a classic example of this comforting and historically significant cocktail.
