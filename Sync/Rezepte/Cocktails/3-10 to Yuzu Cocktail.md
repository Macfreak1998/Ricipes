# History
The "3:10 to Yuzu Cocktail" was created by Joshua Novaski, a bartender at High West Distillery. It gained recognition when it was featured in a Forbes article titled "16 Unusual Cocktail Recipes For Adventurous Drinkers" on November 12, 2020.

The concept behind the cocktail, as described by Novaski, is to showcase how more expensive whiskeys can excel in a sour format. The inclusion of yuzu, a Japanese citrus, is intended to add a layer of complexity to the drink's citrus notes. A unique addition is tamari, which contributes a subtle saltiness and umami, enhancing the cocktail's depth and balance.
