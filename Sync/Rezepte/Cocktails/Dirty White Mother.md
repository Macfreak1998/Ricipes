# History
The "Dirty White Mother" cocktail is a variation of the "Dirty Mother" cocktail, which is an American drink that originated in the 1970s. The "Dirty Mother" is essentially a twist on the Black Russian, using brandy instead of vodka, combined with coffee liqueur.

The "Dirty White Mother" specifically adds cream or half-and-half to the "Dirty Mother" recipe, providing extra sweetness, a richer, creamier texture, and a lighter color. This makes it a close relative to the White Russian, but with a brandy base.

While the exact meaning behind the name "Dirty Mother" isn't explicitly detailed in historical accounts, it likely plays on the "Mother" cocktail theme and the "dirty" descriptor often used in drinks to imply a slight alteration or a less "clean" (e.g., cloudy from cream) appearance. The "White" in "Dirty White Mother" clearly refers to the addition of cream, giving it a lighter, opaque appearance.
