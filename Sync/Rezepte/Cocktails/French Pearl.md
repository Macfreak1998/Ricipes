# History
The "French Pearl" cocktail was created by Audrey Saunders in 2006 at the Pegu Club in New York City.

This elegant drink serves as a tribute to the Beaux-Arts Neoclassical architectural movement prevalent in France during the late 1800s, a period when pastis, an anise-flavored liqueur, was a popular and fashionable beverage. The "pearl" in its name refers to the cocktail's distinctive visual opacity, known as "louching." This effect naturally occurs when an anise-flavored spirit or liqueur is mixed with water, causing it to turn cloudy.

The cocktail typically features gin, lime juice, simple syrup, mint, and pastis or absinthe. This particular recipe includes Gin, Lime Juice, Simple Syrup, Fresh Mint, and a dash of Absinthe, creating a refreshing and herbaceous drink with a subtle anise note and a beautiful cloudy appearance.
