# History
The Chrysanthemum is a sophisticated pre-Prohibition cocktail that first appeared in Hugo Ensslin's 1916 book "Recipes for Mixed Drinks." This was one of the earliest American bartending manuals, published just before Prohibition would fundamentally change cocktail culture.

The original recipe called for equal parts dry vermouth and Bénédictine with a small amount of absinthe, creating an elegant, low-ABV aperitif that showcased the complexity of fortified wines and liqueurs rather than relying on base spirits. This approach was common in the pre-Prohibition era when cocktails often featured vermouth as a primary ingredient rather than just a modifier.

The cocktail was later adapted by legendary bartender Harry Craddock in his iconic 1930 "Savoy Cocktail Book," cementing its place in classic cocktail canon. However, like many pre-Prohibition drinks, the Chrysanthemum fell into obscurity for decades.

The drink experienced a remarkable revival in the mid-2000s following the legalization of absinthe in the United States in 2007 (it had been banned since 1912). Craft bartenders rediscovered this gem as part of the broader cocktail renaissance, appreciating its herbal complexity and elegant restraint.

The Chrysanthemum stands out as a vermouth-forward cocktail at a time when most classic recipes use vermouth sparingly. The Bénédictine adds honeyed, spiced notes, while the absinthe provides an anise backbone and aromatic complexity. The result is a sophisticated aperitif that's simultaneously sweet, herbal, and botanical.

Modern bartenders often adjust the ratios slightly, sometimes using 2 oz dry vermouth to 1 oz Bénédictine to balance the sweetness, though purists stick to Ensslin's original equal-parts formula. The orange twist garnish adds essential citrus oils that lift the herbal notes.

The cocktail represents the pre-Prohibition era's appreciation for lower-proof, complex drinks and has become a favorite among bartenders looking to showcase quality vermouth and the art of balancing liqueurs.
