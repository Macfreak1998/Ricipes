# History
The "Havana Special" cocktail has its roots in Havana, Cuba, specifically at the renowned El Floridita bar. It is believed to have been created by Constante Ribalaigua, a celebrated bartender and owner of El Floridita.

The cocktail's name, "Havana Special," is a tribute to a train called the "Havana Especial" that operated from Miami to Key West between 1918 and 1935. After the train journey, tourists would take a ship from Key West to Havana. The bartender at El Floridita developed this drink to commemorate this train route.

The Havana Special is considered a variation of the classic Daiquiri. It embodies the traditional flavors of Latin Caribbean rum and pineapple, incorporating the popular use of Maraschino liqueur in Cuba during that era. The recipe for this cocktail was documented in La Floridita Cocktail book in 1935. This particular recipe features Pineapple Juice, Maraschino Liqueur, and White Rum, creating a refreshing and fruity tropical drink.
