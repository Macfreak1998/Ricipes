# History
The "Mary Pickford" cocktail is a classic tropical drink with a rich history rooted in the Prohibition era. It is named after the iconic Canadian-American silent film actress, Mary Pickford.

The cocktail originated in Havana, Cuba, during the 1920s, a period when Americans flocked to the island seeking legal alcohol and a vibrant bar scene due to Prohibition in the United States. The most popular story suggests the drink was created in honor of Mary Pickford during a visit to Havana with her husband, Douglas Fairbanks, and possibly Charlie Chaplin. However, historical records indicate that Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks did not visit Cuba during their marriage, casting some doubt on the exact circumstances of its creation, though it was undoubtedly named after her. The precise bartender credited with its invention is also debated, with Fred Kaufmann of the Sevilla-Biltmore Hotel often cited. The Mary Pickford cocktail first appeared in print in Basil Woon's 1928 book "When It's Cocktail Time in Cuba" and later in Harry Craddock's 1930 "The Savoy Cocktail Book."

The Mary Pickford cocktail embodies the glamour of the Prohibition era, blending American celebrity culture with Caribbean ingredients. It represents a cultural exchange where Hollywood's allure met Cuban cocktail innovation. The drink's enduring popularity stems from its appealing flavor profile and its connection to a significant moment in social and drinking history, predating the tiki cocktail movement.

This vibrant, tropical cocktail typically features white rum, fresh pineapple juice, grenadine, and maraschino liqueur. It is known for its light, fruity, and balanced taste, distinguishing it from many other rum cocktails of its time that often leaned on darker rums or sour citrus. The combination of ingredients results in a complex, refreshing drink with a delicate aftertaste and an elegant blush-pink color from the grenadine.
