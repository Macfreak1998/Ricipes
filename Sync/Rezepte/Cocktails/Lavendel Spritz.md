# History
The Lavender Spritz is a modern and aromatic twist on the classic Italian Spritz. The original Spritz, a simple mix of wine and sparkling water, has been enjoyed in Italy for over a century. The modern version, with prosecco and a bitter liqueur, has become a global phenomenon.

The Lavender Spritz is a recent creation that adds the delicate and floral flavor of lavender to the classic spritz formula. This is typically done with a lavender liqueur or a lavender-infused syrup. The result is a refreshing and elegant cocktail that is perfect for a summer day. The use of lavender in cocktails has become increasingly popular in recent years, as bartenders and home mixologists have embraced the use of botanical and floral flavors in their drinks.
