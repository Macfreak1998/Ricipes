# History
The "Clover Club" cocktail is a pre-Prohibition classic with a rich history, originating in Philadelphia in the late 1800s. It is named after the exclusive gentlemen's club of the same name, which was chartered in 1882 and met at the Bellevue-Stratford Hotel. This club was a popular gathering spot for prominent writers, lawyers, bankers, and businessmen who would convene to discuss the issues of the day. The cocktail became a favorite among this "genteel set," symbolizing sophistication and wit, much like its patrons.

The Clover Club cocktail is typically made with gin, fresh lemon juice, raspberry syrup, and egg white. The egg white is a key ingredient, acting as an emulsifier to create the drink's characteristic foamy head and adding a silky texture. Early published recipes for the cocktail appeared as early as 1908, with some variations including French vermouth.

Initially very popular from around 1901 until Prohibition, the drink's popularity declined significantly during the mid-20th century. It experienced a resurgence in the 21st century, partly due to its appearance in modern cocktail books and the opening of a Brooklyn bar named "Clover Club" in 2008 by Julie Reiner, which helped reintroduce the classic drink to a new generation. Today, it is celebrated for its delicate balance of tart lemon, sweet raspberry, and smooth texture, making it an enduring classic.
