# History
The Spiced Club is a modern tropical cocktail created by London-based Instagram bartender @princecornerbar. The cocktail represents a contemporary approach to rum highballs, combining spiced rum with berry flavors and mint for a refreshing, effervescent drink.

According to the creator, "The Spiced Club is a refreshing and fruity cocktail combines the rich, warming notes of spiced rum with the tartness of fresh lime and the sweetness of raspberry syrup. Topped with crisp soda water, it creates a light, effervescent drink with a well-balanced depth of flavor. The mint leaves add a fresh, aromatic finish, making it a perfect choice for a vibrant, tropical-inspired cocktail."

**Flavor Architecture:**

The drink's name "Spiced Club" cleverly plays on the "club soda" ingredient while highlighting the spiced rum base. The flavor profile balances several elements:

- **Spiced Rum**: Provides vanilla, cinnamon, and warming spice notes as the foundation
- **Raspberry Syrup**: Adds fruity sweetness and vibrant color
- **Lime Juice**: Cuts through sweetness with tart citrus acidity
- **Soda Water**: Adds effervescence and lightness, making it refreshing
- **Mint**: Provides aromatic freshness without the muddling of a mojito

**Modern Highball Evolution:**

The Spiced Club fits into the contemporary trend of elevated highballs—taking the simple spirit-and-soda format and adding complexity through syrups, fresh juice, and aromatics. Unlike a classic rum and Coke, this drink offers more sophisticated flavor layers while maintaining the easy-drinking quality of a highball.

**Technique Notes:**

The recipe specifically calls for shaking the rum, lime, and raspberry first (rather than building everything in the glass), which ensures proper integration and chilling of these core ingredients. The soda water is then added gently to preserve carbonation.

The Spiced Club demonstrates how modern bartenders create approachable, refreshing cocktails that work for both casual drinking and more refined occasions—offering complexity without pretension.
