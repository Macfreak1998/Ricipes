# History
The "Schumann's Gimlet" is a notable variation of the classic Gimlet cocktail, created in 1983 by the renowned German bartender and author Charles Schumann. Schumann, known for his "American Bar book" published in 1995, developed this recipe as a fresh take on the traditional Gimlet.

The classic Gimlet typically consists of a simple 50-50 mix of gin and lime cordial. However, Schumann's recipe distinguishes itself by incorporating fresh citrus sourness, specifically using lemon juice, and sometimes additional lime juice, to balance the richness of the lime cordial. This approach deviates from the classic Gimlet's reliance solely on lime cordial. The Schumann's Gimlet adds lemon juice and lime juice to the gin, offering a zestier version of the cocktail. This recipe is identical to the "Schumann's Gimlet 1983" and represents the same creation.
