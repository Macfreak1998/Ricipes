# History
The "Fiesta" cocktail is a name applied to various drinks, often named to evoke a celebratory or festive atmosphere, drawing from the Spanish word "fiesta," meaning "feast" or "festival." There isn't a single, universally recognized historical origin for a cocktail specifically named "Fiesta," but rather several distinct recipes.

This particular recipe, featuring Lime Juice, Grenadine, Pernod, Calvados, and White Rum, is a unique interpretation of a "Fiesta" cocktail. It is very similar to a recipe that combines white rum, grenadine syrup, lime juice, French vermouth, and Calvados brandy. This blend offers a complex flavor profile, combining the tropical notes of white rum with the apple brandy character of Calvados, the anise notes of Pernod, and the sweet-tart balance of lime and grenadine. The inclusion of Pernod adds an intriguing herbal and slightly bitter dimension, making it a sophisticated and celebratory drink.
