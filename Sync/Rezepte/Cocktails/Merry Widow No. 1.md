# History
The "Merry Widow No. 1" cocktail, often simply called the Merry Widow Cocktail, has a rich history tied to a popular theatrical production.

The cocktail first appeared in Hugo Ensslin's "Recipes for Mixed Drinks," published in either 1916 or its second edition in 1917. It also featured in later influential cocktail books such as Harry Craddock's 1930 "The Savoy Cocktail Book" and Albert Stevens Crockett's 1935 "The Old Waldorf-Astoria Bar Book."

The drink takes its name from the highly successful operetta "The Merry Widow" (Die lustige Witwe), which premiered in Vienna in 1905. The operetta made its American debut on Broadway at the New Amsterdam Theatre in 1907 and gained immense popularity worldwide, leading to ballet and multiple film adaptations. The cocktail was named in response to the widespread success of this theatrical piece.

The Merry Widow cocktail is often characterized as a sophisticated, vermouth-forward martini variation with a distinctive herbal and spicy profile. Its pre-Prohibition styling includes a significant amount of vermouth, along with dashes of absinthe (or Pernod, as in this recipe) and Benedictine liqueur. The absinthe contributes a unique aroma and blends well with the herbal notes of Benedictine and the spices of Peychaud's bitters, creating a complex and earthy flavor profile. While it shares a base with a martini (gin and vermouth), it distinguishes itself with a more intricate and lingering herbal aftertaste.
