## Introduction: Bond's Drinking Culture

### The Literary Lush

Ian Fleming's James Bond is many things: spy, seducer, killer, and connoisseur. But perhaps no aspect of Bond's character is as thoroughly documented as his drinking habits. Across Fleming's fourteen novels and nine short stories, 007 consumes an impressive 317 drinks—an average weekly intake of 92 units of alcohol, or four times the recommended safe amount for a male adult.

This isn't mere background color. Fleming used Bond's drinking as character development, world-building, and cultural commentary. Every cocktail tells a story; every sip reveals something about Bond's refined tastes, his attention to detail, and his embrace of life's pleasures in the shadow of constant danger.

### More Than Just Martinis

While the Martini has become synonymous with James Bond—mentioned 58 times across Fleming's works—the literary 007's palate was far more diverse than popular culture suggests. He drank 16 gin Martinis and 19 vodka Martinis, but also consumed bourbon (his preferred whiskey), champagne (particularly Taittinger), and even sake in Japan.

The immortal line "shaken and not stirred" first appeared in print in *Diamonds Are Forever* (1956), but Bond's relationship with cocktails began earlier, with an Americano in *Casino Royale* (1953), before he even invented his famous Vesper.

### Fleming's Own Influence

Ian Fleming himself was a dedicated drinker and bon vivant. His personal tastes heavily influenced Bond's choices. Fleming's love of champagne, particularly Taittinger, appears throughout the novels. His appreciation for quality spirits and proper cocktail preparation wasn't just literary flourish—it reflected his own lifestyle.

This book examines every cocktail mentioned in Fleming's Bond novels, exploring not just the recipes, but the fascinating histories behind these drinks, the cultural contexts that created them, and why Fleming chose them for specific moments in Bond's adventures.

# Chapter 1: The Martini Dynasty

## The Dry Martini: A Cocktail History

### From Martinez to Martini

The Martini's lineage begins with the Martinez, a 19th-century mixture first recorded by legendary bartender "Professor" Jerry Thomas in his 1887 edition of *Bartender's Guide: How to Mix All Kinds of Plain and Fancy Drinks*. The Martinez combined Old Tom gin, sweet vermouth, maraschino liqueur, and bitters—quite different from today's austere Martini.

Two competing origin stories credit either Jerry Thomas at San Francisco's Occidental Hotel in the late 1850s, or a bartender named Richelieu at a saloon in Martinez, California. What's certain is that the Martinez predated the modern Martini by several decades.

### The Evolution of Dryness

The ingredients for what we recognize as a Martini only became available in the 1870s when dry gin was first distilled in the United States. Bartenders began experimenting with dry vermouth instead of sweet vermouth in the early 1900s, creating a "drier" version that was christened the Martini.

The early Martini was considerably sweeter than today's version. Recipes included Old Tom gin (a sweetened gin), sweet or Italian vermouth, and additions such as gum syrup, maraschino liqueur, bitters, curaçao, and even absinthe. The drink gradually shed these embellishments.

By 1922, the Martini reached its most recognizable form: London dry gin and dry vermouth combined at a ratio of 2:1, stirred in a mixing glass with ice cubes, creating a clear and silky-smooth drink.

### The Great Gin vs. Vodka Debate

The Martini was originally a gin cocktail, and purists insist it should remain so. Gin's botanical complexity—juniper, coriander, angelica root, and citrus peels—provides the drink's characteristic herbal profile.

The vodka Martini emerged in the 1950s and 1960s as vodka gained popularity in America. The "vodka Martini" or "vodkatini" became fashionable, with vodka's neutral profile creating a smoother, less assertive cocktail. Some prefer gin's sharp, botanical punch; others appreciate vodka's silky neutrality.

James Bond's preference for vodka Martinis—ordering both 16 gin and 19 vodka versions across the novels—helped legitimize the vodka variant, though he shows no strong preference for one over the other.

### Shaken vs. Stirred: The Great Controversy

The traditional method for making a Martini is stirring the ingredients with ice in a mixing glass. This produces a clear, silky-smooth drink with minimal dilution and no air bubbles. Stirring gently chills and dilutes the spirits while maintaining the drink's elegant clarity.

Shaking, on the other hand, introduces air into the mixture, creating a cloudy, frothy texture with tiny ice chips. The vigorous action also provides more dilution and a colder drink.

Critics argue that shaking "bruises" the gin, though this is more metaphorical than scientific—the violent action does break down some of the delicate botanical compounds. Proponents of shaking counter that it creates a more complex flavor profile and better integrates the ingredients.

Bond's insistence on shaking was unconventional and remains so. Most professional bartenders still stir a classic Martini. However, Bond wasn't entirely wrong: shaking does make sense for his Vesper, which contains both gin and vodka and benefits from the aggressive mixing to properly integrate three different spirits.

### In the Fleming Novels

The Dry Martini appears 58 times across Fleming's works. Bond orders them with specific requirements:

- **Live and Let Die**: Medium dry Martinis made with House of Lords gin and Martini & Rossi vermouth at the King Cole Bar
- **Goldfinger**: Double vodka Martinis with a slice of lemon peel (ordering two, with two more to come in ten minutes)
- **Thunderball**: Double dry Martinis on the rocks with Felix Leiter at their hotel

Bond's Martini specifications vary by location and mood, but he consistently demands quality ingredients and proper preparation.

## The Vesper: Bond's Signature Creation

### "Three Measures of Gordon's..."

The Vesper Martini represents one of literature's most famous cocktail recipes. In *Casino Royale* (1953), Bond creates and names the drink after Vesper Lynd, the double agent who captures his heart and ultimately betrays him.

The original recipe, as specified by Bond:

> "Three measures of Gordon's, one of vodka, half a measure of Kina Lillet. Shake it very well until it's ice-cold, then add a large thin slice of lemon peel. Got it?"

Bond adds: "I never have more than one drink before dinner. But I do like that one to be large and very strong and very cold and very well-made."

The drink was to be served "in a deep champagne goblet."

### The Naming

Bond initially searches for a name for his creation. After meeting Vesper Lynd, he tells her:

> "Later in the novel, after being introduced to the beautiful Vesper Lynd, Bond tells Vesper that his search for a name is over if she will permit him to name the drink after her."

The drink's name becomes poignant when Vesper's betrayal is revealed. The Vesper represents both Bond's capacity for love and his ultimate disillusionment—a cocktail that embodies both pleasure and pain.

### The Kina Lillet Problem

The Vesper as Fleming wrote it cannot be made today. Kina Lillet, the key ingredient, ceased production in 1986. This quinquina (quinine-flavored) aperitif wine was more bitter than its modern successor, Lillet Blanc, which replaced it.

Modern bartenders face a dilemma: use Lillet Blanc, which lacks the original's bitter complexity, or find an alternative? Several solutions exist:

**Lillet Blanc**: The official replacement from the same company, but sweeter and less bitter than the original.

**Cocchi Americano**: Most cocktail historians agree this Italian aperitif most closely approximates Kina Lillet's flavor profile, with its quinine bitterness and orange notes.

**Kina L'Aéro d'Or**: Tempus Fugit Spirits created this Lillet recreation specifically for bartenders seeking historical accuracy.

### Why Shake the Vesper?

Bond specifies shaking "very well until it's ice-cold." This makes more sense for the Vesper than for a standard Martini. With three different spirits (gin, vodka, and Kina Lillet), vigorous shaking helps integrate the ingredients more thoroughly than gentle stirring would.

The shaking also provides maximum dilution and chilling, creating a very cold drink—essential in the heat of Casino Royale's setting.

### Bond's Technical Specifications

Bond demonstrates impressive cocktail knowledge in his preferences:

> "Bond noted in the novel: 'if you can get a vodka made with grain instead of potatoes, you will find it still better', showing his preference for grain-based vodka."

This distinction matters. Grain vodkas (made from wheat, rye, or corn) tend to be smoother and slightly sweeter than potato vodkas, which can have an earthier character. Bond's palate was refined enough to detect the difference.

### In Popular Culture

The Vesper became Bond's signature drink, though oddly, it rarely appears in the films. The 2006 *Casino Royale* film includes the drink, with Daniel Craig's Bond ordering it exactly as Fleming wrote it. The bartender's confused response—"Shaken or stirred?"—and Bond's irritated "Do I look like I give a damn?" reflects modern audiences' expectation that Bond always specifies this detail.

### Modern Vesper Recipe

**Ingredients:**
- 3 oz (90 ml) Gordon's gin
- 1 oz (30 ml) vodka (preferably grain-based)
- 0.5 oz (15 ml) Cocchi Americano (substitute for Kina Lillet)
- Lemon peel

**Method:**
1. Fill a cocktail shaker with ice
2. Add gin, vodka, and Cocchi Americano
3. Shake vigorously until well-chilled (about 15 seconds)
4. Strain into a chilled champagne coupe or Martini glass
5. Express the oils from a large lemon peel over the drink and garnish

The result is a strong, botanical, slightly bitter cocktail with remarkable complexity—a drink that reflects Bond's sophisticated tastes and uncompromising standards.

## Gordon's Gin: A 250-Year Legacy

### The Founder: Alexander Gordon

In 1769, Alexander Gordon—a Londoner of Scottish descent—opened a distillery in the Southwark area of London, well known for its excellent, clean water supply essential to quality gin production. Gordon was the 10th child in his family and brought both ambition and expertise to his venture.

In 1786, seeking expansion, Gordon moved his distillery to Clerkenwell, a neighborhood that would become synonymous with London gin production.

### The Recipe

Gordon developed a "Special London Dry Gin" whose recipe has remained essentially unchanged for over 250 years. According to the manufacturer, Gordon's gin is triple-distilled and flavored with:

- Juniper berries (the defining botanical)
- Coriander seeds
- Angelica root
- Licorice
- Orris root
- Orange peel
- Lemon peel

The exact recipe, including the proportions and any additional botanicals, remains a closely guarded secret since 1769.

### Global Dominance

Gordon's gin became and remains the world's best-selling London dry gin. It has held the position as the UK's number one gin since the late 19th century—an extraordinary testament to consistent quality and brand loyalty spanning multiple centuries.

### The Diageo Empire

Today, Gordon's is owned by Diageo, the British multinational alcoholic beverage company. Despite corporate ownership, the brand maintains its commitment to the original recipe and production methods that Alexander Gordon established.

### Why Fleming Chose Gordon's

Ian Fleming's specification of Gordon's gin in the Vesper recipe wasn't arbitrary. Gordon's represented:

1. **British Heritage**: A quintessentially British spirit for a quintessentially British spy
2. **Availability**: Gordon's was widely available internationally, making the Vesper replicable
3. **Quality**: Recognized as a premium gin without being ostentatiously expensive
4. **Consistency**: The unchanged recipe meant the same flavor profile anywhere in the world

Bond's choice of Gordon's reflects his practical sophistication—appreciating quality without unnecessary pretension.

# Chapter 2: Italian Elegance

## The Americano: Bond's First Drink

### The Milano-Torino Origins

Before it was the Americano, this cocktail was called the Milano-Torino, a name honoring the geographical origins of its two key ingredients: Campari from Milan and vermouth from Turin.

In the 1860s, at Caffé Campari in Milan, Gaspare Campari mixed his signature red bitter liqueur with sweet vermouth. This simple two-ingredient drink celebrated the best of northern Italian aperitivo culture.

### The American Connection

The drink's transformation to "Americano" occurred when bartenders at Gaspare Campari's bar began adding club soda, creating a longer, more refreshing version. The name "Americano" emerged because of the cocktail's immense popularity among American tourists, particularly during Prohibition when Americans flocked to Europe seeking legal alcohol.

American tourists, especially in the 1920s, favored lighter, longer drinks than traditional Italian aperitivi. The addition of soda water made the bitter Campari more accessible to American palates while creating a refreshing, low-alcohol cocktail perfect for warm Italian afternoons.

### The IBA Official Recipe

The International Bartenders Association recognizes the Americano as an official cocktail:

**Ingredients:**
- 1 oz (30 ml) Campari
- 1 oz (30 ml) sweet vermouth
- Club soda
- Orange slice or lemon peel garnish

**Method:**
1. Build in a rocks glass filled with ice
2. Add Campari and sweet vermouth
3. Top with club soda
4. Stir gently
5. Garnish with orange slice or lemon peel

### Bond's Specifications

In *Casino Royale* (1953), James Bond orders an Americano at the Hermitage bar—the first drink he orders in Fleming's entire series. Bond demonstrates his characteristic attention to detail by specifying that the soda water must be Perrier.

This detail reveals Bond's sophistication: Perrier's mineral content and effervescence differ from standard club soda, providing a more refined bubble and subtle flavor enhancement.

The Americano appears again in:
- *From Russia With Love*
- The short story *Risico* (in *For Your Eyes Only*)
- The short story *From A View To A Kill* (in *For Your Eyes Only*), where Bond drinks it outdoors at French cafés

### Cultural Significance

The Americano represents the aperitivo tradition—pre-dinner drinks meant to stimulate appetite and facilitate conversation. Bond's choice of an Americano for his first literary drink establishes him as someone who appreciates European culture and understands the rituals of refined drinking.

At roughly 15% ABV (alcohol by volume), the Americano is one of the lighter cocktails in Bond's repertoire, appropriate for afternoon drinking or before dinner when a clear head remains essential.

## The Negroni: A Count's Innovation

### Florence, 1919: The Classic Origin

The most widely accepted origin story places the Negroni's creation at Caffè Casoni in Florence in 1919. Count Camillo Negroni, a regular patron, asked bartender Fosco Scarselli to strengthen his usual Americano by replacing the soda water with gin.

Scarselli obliged, creating a more robust cocktail. To distinguish it from the standard Americano, he also swapped the traditional lemon garnish for an orange slice. Other patrons began asking Scarselli for "what the Count usually has," and the name "Negroni" gradually stuck to the drink itself.

The café was located on Via de' Tornabuoni in Florence and later became known as Caffè Giacosa. The establishment supported the 1919 origin story until it closed in 2017.

### Historical Controversies

Not everyone accepts the Count Camillo story. Cocktail historian David Wondrich researched Camillo Negroni's background, finding his status as a count questionable—his grandfather Luigi Negroni was indeed a count, but Camillo's own title remains unverified.

Some descendants of French General Pascal Olivier de Negroni claim their ancestor invented the drink in 1857 in Senegal, predating the Florence story by over six decades. However, this claim lacks documentation, and the Florence origin remains the generally accepted history.

### The Perfect Balance

What makes the Negroni remarkable is its perfect balance of three strong flavors:

1. **Gin** (1 oz): Provides botanical complexity and alcoholic backbone
2. **Campari** (1 oz): Delivers bitter orange and herbal notes
3. **Sweet Vermouth** (1 oz): Adds sweetness and aromatic depth

This equal-parts formula creates a cocktail that's simultaneously bitter, sweet, strong, and refreshing—a complexity that has earned the Negroni a devoted following among cocktail enthusiasts.

### Bond's Negroni Moment

In the short story *Risico* (from *For Your Eyes Only*, 1960), Bond orders a "Negroni with Gordon's gin" at the bar in Rome's Excelsior hotel.

This specification demonstrates Bond's attention to detail. While many bars might use a standard house gin, Bond ensures he gets Gordon's—the same gin he specifies in his Vesper. This consistency suggests Bond has identified specific flavor profiles he prefers and insists on them regardless of location.

### The Negroni Renaissance

While respected by bartenders throughout the 20th century, the Negroni experienced a renaissance in the 21st century, becoming one of the most popular cocktails in craft cocktail bars worldwide. Its bitterness, once off-putting to mainstream drinkers, became fashionable as palates evolved and appreciation for complex, less sweet cocktails grew.

### Classic Negroni Recipe

**Ingredients:**
- 1 oz (30 ml) gin (Bond specifies Gordon's)
- 1 oz (30 ml) Campari
- 1 oz (30 ml) sweet vermouth
- Orange peel

**Method:**
1. Fill a rocks glass with ice
2. Add gin, Campari, and sweet vermouth
3. Stir until well-chilled
4. Garnish with orange peel

## Campari: The Red Bitter Legend

### Gaspare Campari: The Inventor

Born in 1828 as the 10th child of a farming family, Gaspare Campari rose from humble origins to create one of the world's most iconic liqueurs. In 1860, working at his caffè in Novara, Italy, Campari began experimenting to create distinctive drinks to serve his customers.

One creation stood out: a bright red bitter aperitivo he originally called "Bitter all'uso d'Hollanda" (literally "Dutch-style bitter") because he was inspired by a cordial from Holland. This would become simply "Campari."

### The Secret Recipe

The exact recipe remains a closely guarded secret since its creation over 160 years ago. What's known is that Campari is a blend of:

- Aromatic herbs
- Bitter orange
- Various spices and botanicals
- Alcohol
- Water
- Sugar

The recipe has remained essentially unchanged since 1860, a remarkable feat of consistency in the spirits industry.

### The Crimson Color

Originally, Campari derived its distinctive crimson color from carmine dye, extracted from crushed cochineal insects. This natural coloring gave Campari its signature appearance and became part of its identity.

In 2006, Campari switched to an artificial coloring to accommodate various dietary restrictions and regulations, though the company maintains the exact shade remained identical.

### From Novara to Milan

Gaspare's big break came when he moved into the newly built Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II in September 1867. He opened Caffé Campari in this prestigious location, ideally situated on the left-hand side of the Galleria entrance facing the Duomo cathedral.

The caffè became a gathering place for Milan's cultural and social elite, establishing Campari as a sophisticated drink for discerning palates.

### Building an Empire

Gaspare died in 1882, passing the business to his son Davide, who transformed the family business into an international brand. Under Davide's leadership, Campari expanded beyond Milan, eventually becoming a global phenomenon.

Today, the Campari Group is a major international spirits company, but the original Campari bitter remains its flagship product, largely unchanged from Gaspare's 1860 creation.

### In Cocktail Culture

Campari's bitter orange profile makes it essential for numerous classic cocktails:

- **Americano**: Campari + sweet vermouth + soda
- **Negroni**: Campari + gin + sweet vermouth
- **Boulevardier**: Campari + bourbon + sweet vermouth (a Negroni variation)
- **Campari Spritz**: Campari + prosecco + soda

Bond's encounters with Campari (in Americanos and the Negroni) reflect the aperitivo culture that Fleming experienced during his time in Italy and appreciated enough to incorporate into his spy's sophisticated lifestyle.

## Vermouth: Turin's Triumph

### Antonio Benedetto Carpano: The Pioneer

In 1786, a 21-year-old Antonio Benedetto Carpano created something revolutionary. Working at his wine shop in Turin, directly across from the Royal Palace, Carpano took Moscato wine and infused it with 30 botanicals, including the key ingredient: wormwood (Wermut in German, from which "vermouth" derives).

He called his creation "Vermut," and it would change aperitivo culture forever.

### Royal Patronage

Carpano's location proved providential. King Vittorio Amedeo III of Savoy, living across the street, discovered the new drink and became an enthusiastic patron. Royal approval transformed vermouth from a local curiosity into a must-have beverage for Italian nobility.

Vermouth proved so popular that Carpano's shop operated 24 hours a day to meet demand—extraordinary for the 18th century.

### Sweet vs. Dry

Carpano's original vermouth was sweet, establishing the Italian "red" or "sweet" vermouth style. This sweet vermouth became essential to numerous cocktails, including the Americano and Negroni that Bond enjoys.

Dry vermouth emerged later, primarily in France, creating the second major vermouth category. Dry vermouth's lighter, less sweet profile made it ideal for Martinis.

### The Carpano Legacy

The Carpano family developed several notable products:

- **Punt e Mes** (1870): A deep red vermouth with pronounced sweet and bitter flavors
- **Antica Formula** (2001): A recreation of an 1780s Carpano recipe, packaged in a beautiful blown glass bottle with a replica of the original 1786 label

### In Bond's Cocktails

Sweet Italian vermouth appears in several of Bond's drinks:

- **Americano**: Sweet vermouth + Campari + soda
- **Negroni**: Sweet vermouth + Campari + gin

The quality of vermouth dramatically affects these cocktails. Cheap, oxidized vermouth creates flat, unpleasant drinks. Fresh, quality vermouth—as Bond would certainly insist upon—provides aromatic complexity and proper balance.

# Chapter 3: American Classics

## The Old Fashioned: Whiskey's Crown Jewel

### The Name's Origin

The Old Fashioned isn't named for a place or person—it's named for a method. In the late 1800s, cocktail culture was becoming increasingly elaborate, with bartenders creating complex drinks featuring multiple spirits, liqueurs, and exotic ingredients.

Some patrons rebelled against this trend, asking for cocktails made "in the old-fashioned way"—meaning the simple, traditional formula of spirit, sugar, bitters, and water. The name stuck, and the Old Fashioned was born.

### The Pendennis Club Myth

Popular mythology credits the Pendennis Club, a Louisville, Kentucky gentlemen's club founded in 1881, with inventing the Old Fashioned. The story involves Colonel James Pepper, a Pendennis Club member and frequent guest at New York's Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, introducing the drink to the broader public.

Cocktail historians Robert Simonson, David Wondrich, and Simon Difford flatly reject this origin story as myth. The evidence against it:

- The Chicago Daily Tribune mentioned "old fashioned cocktails" in February 1880—before the Pendennis Club existed
- Whiskey "Old Fashioned Cocktail" recipes appeared in print by 1888
- The drink wasn't invented; it was simply the traditional way cocktails had always been made

Despite the disputed origin, Louisville named the Old Fashioned its official cocktail in 2015.

### The Classic Formula

The Old Fashioned represents cocktail making at its most elemental:

**Ingredients:**
- 2 oz bourbon or rye whiskey
- 1 sugar cube (or 1/2 oz simple syrup)
- 2-3 dashes Angostura bitters
- Orange peel
- Optional: cherry

**Method:**
1. Place sugar cube in rocks glass
2. Add bitters and a splash of water
3. Muddle until sugar dissolves
4. Add whiskey and ice
5. Stir until well-chilled
6. Garnish with orange peel (and optionally a cherry)

### Bond's Old Fashioned

In *Live and Let Die* (1954), Bond orders Old Fashioneds on the Silver Phantom train with Solitaire. True to form, he specifies the bourbon: **Old Grand-Dad**.

In *Thunderball* (1961), after a day in the Bahamas, Bond indulges in a "double bourbon old-fashioned" before taking a nap—a proper use of this strong, leisurely cocktail.

### Old Grand-Dad: Bond's Bourbon Choice

Old Grand-Dad bourbon was created by Basil Hayden, a distiller who made his name producing bourbon with a higher percentage of rye in the mash bill, creating a spicier flavor profile. He passed the distilling art to his son and grandson—hence "Grand-Dad."

Fleming's choice of Old Grand-Dad wasn't random. The brand represented quality American whiskey with character—not the smoothest bourbon available, but one with personality and punch, much like Bond himself.

### The Fruit Controversy

Modern Old Fashioneds often arrive muddled with orange slices, cherries, and sometimes even pineapple. Cocktail purists consider this an abomination—the original Old Fashioned used only an orange peel for aroma, with maybe a cherry for garnish.

The muddled fruit trend emerged mid-20th century and has proven difficult to eradicate despite widespread criticism from serious bartenders. Bond's specification of the drink suggests he would have preferred the classic, non-muddled version.

## The Stinger: Prohibition's Elegant Secret

### Origins in High Society

The Stinger originated around 1890, possibly derived from "The Judge," a cocktail made with brandy, crème de menthe, and simple syrup found in William Schmidt's 1892 cocktail book *The Flowing Bowl*.

By its first appearance in print in Jacques Straub's 1914 book "Drinks," the Stinger had been simplified to just brandy and crème de menthe—a two-ingredient powerhouse that became known as a "society drink," meaning exclusively for the upper classes.

### Prohibition's Perfect Cocktail

The Stinger gained massive popularity during Prohibition in the United States. The reason was practical: crème de menthe's strong mint flavor could effectively mask the taste of inferior-quality bootleg brandies.

Reginald "Reggie" Vanderbilt, a wealthy socialite, served Stingers frequently to guests during the 1920s, cementing its reputation as a sophisticated choice despite Prohibition's crude alcohol landscape.

### An After-Dinner Tradition

Unlike most cocktails, which serve as aperitifs (pre-dinner drinks), the Stinger was traditionally considered a digestif—an after-dinner drink meant to aid digestion and provide a gentle conclusion to an evening.

This positioning made sense: the combination of brandy's warmth and mint's cool freshness created a soothing, refreshing finish to a meal. The Stinger's relatively high alcohol content (typically around 30% ABV after dilution) also made it more appropriate for evening's end than beginning.

### The Recipe Debate

Stinger recipes vary significantly. The classic formula calls for three parts brandy to one part white crème de menthe, but some recipes use equal parts, creating a mintier, sweeter drink.

**Classic Stinger Recipe:**
- 2 oz (60 ml) brandy
- 0.5-1 oz (15-30 ml) white crème de menthe (not green)

**Method:**
1. Fill a cocktail shaker with ice
2. Add brandy and crème de menthe
3. Shake until well-chilled
4. Strain into a chilled cocktail glass

### Bond's Stinger Moments

The Stinger appears multiple times in Fleming's novels:

**Diamonds Are Forever** (1956):
- At the 21 Club in New York: After dinner with Tiffany Case (caviar and cutlets with asparagus), they finish with coffee and Stingers made with white Crème de Menthe
- Aboard the Queen Elizabeth: After dining at the Veranda Grill, Tiffany asks for a coffee and a Stinger made with white Crème de Menthe, then orders another after Bond explains the Auction Pool

**Thunderball** (1961):
- Bond and Felix Leiter order "coffee and a stinger at the bar" at the Nassau Casino

Fleming's consistent specification of **white** crème de menthe is significant. Green crème de menthe would create an unattractive color when mixed with brown brandy. White crème de menthe maintains the drink's elegant appearance while providing the same mint flavor.

### The Stinger's Decline

The Stinger began losing favor with Americans in the late 1970s and became relatively obscure by the early 21st century. The craft cocktail renaissance has brought renewed interest, but it remains less popular than it was during its mid-century heyday.

## The Alexandra/Alexander: Cream and Sophistication

### The Gin Original

The Alexander cocktail first appeared in Hugo Ensslin's 1915/1916 "Recipes for Mixed Drinks," though the drink likely debuted around 1914. The original recipe called for:

- Gin
- White crème de cacao
- Sweet cream

Equal parts of each created a rich, dessert-like cocktail that appealed to those seeking sweeter, more indulgent drinks.

### From Gin to Brandy

As the 20th century progressed, bartenders—including Harry MacElhone, owner of the legendary Harry's New York Bar in Paris—replaced gin with brandy. This created the "Brandy Alexander," which became far more popular than the gin original.

The gin version is now typically called the "Alexander" or "Gin Alexander," while the brandy version became simply "Alexander" or "Brandy Alexander."

### The Name's Mystery

As with many classic cocktails, the Alexander's origin remains unclear. Various theories suggest:

1. **Troy Alexander**: Created by bartender Troy Alexander at New York restaurant Rector's
2. **Royal Wedding**: Created for the 1922 London wedding of Princess Mary and Viscount Lascelles
3. **Baseball Legend**: Named after Philadelphia pitcher Grover Cleveland Alexander (1887-1950)

None of these stories has definitive proof, and the truth likely remains lost to history.

### Spelling Variations

The cocktail appears as Alexander, Alexandre, and Alexandra in various sources. All refer to the same style of cream-based, crème de cacao cocktail.

In Fleming's *Risico* (from *For Your Eyes Only*), Bond encounters an "Alexandra," presumably the gin version given the spelling variant.

### Classic Alexandra/Alexander Recipe

**Gin Alexandra:**
- 1 oz (30 ml) gin
- 1 oz (30 ml) white crème de cacao
- 1 oz (30 ml) heavy cream
- Nutmeg (grated, for garnish)

**Method:**
1. Fill cocktail shaker with ice
2. Add gin, crème de cacao, and cream
3. Shake vigorously until well-chilled
4. Strain into chilled cocktail glass
5. Garnish with freshly grated nutmeg

**Brandy Alexander** (more common modern version):
- Substitute brandy for gin
- All other ingredients remain the same

### Cultural Context

Cream cocktails like the Alexander gained popularity in the early-to-mid 20th century when sweet, rich flavors were more fashionable in cocktails. The drink represents a different era of cocktail culture—one that embraced dessert-like indulgence rather than the bitter, spirit-forward drinks that dominate contemporary craft cocktail culture.

# Chapter 4: International Flavors

## The Bloody Mary: A Parisian Hangover Cure

### Fernand Petiot: The Creator

In 1921, at Harry's New York Bar in Paris, bartender Fernand Petiot created what would become one of the world's most famous cocktails. Harry's Bar, owned by Harry MacElhone, had become a haven for American expats during Prohibition, attracting celebrities including Humphrey Bogart, Ernest Hemingway, and Rita Hayworth.

### The Perfect Storm

Several cultural forces converged to create the Bloody Mary:

1. **Russian émigrés** fleeing the Revolution brought vodka to Paris
2. **Americans** brought canned tomato juice, sold during Prohibition as "tomato juice cocktail"
3. **Petiot's creativity** combined these imported ingredients with spices, lemon juice, and seasoning

The first version was simple: equal parts tomato juice and vodka. This basic combination provided the foundation, but the drink would evolve significantly.

### The American Evolution

When Petiot moved to the United States, American customers requested a spicier drink. In response, Petiot added salt, lemon juice, and Tabasco sauce—ingredients now considered essential to a proper Bloody Mary.

These additions transformed the cocktail from a simple vodka-tomato combination into the complex, savory drink we know today.

### The Name's Origin

According to tradition at Harry's New York Bar, one of the patrons for whom the cocktail was first mixed in 1920 or 1921 declared it looked like his girlfriend Mary, whom he'd met at a cabaret called the Bucket of Blood.

The name stuck, though alternative origin stories exist—including claims that it references Queen Mary I of England ("Bloody Mary") or a waitress named Mary who worked at a Chicago bar called the Bucket of Blood.

### Modern Bloody Mary Recipe

**Ingredients:**
- 2 oz (60 ml) vodka
- 4 oz (120 ml) tomato juice
- 0.5 oz (15 ml) lemon juice
- 2-3 dashes Worcestershire sauce
- 2-3 dashes Tabasco (or to taste)
- Pinch of salt and black pepper
- Pinch of celery salt
- Celery stick, lemon wedge, olive, or other garnish

**Method:**
1. Fill a highball glass with ice
2. Add all ingredients
3. Stir well (or gently roll between two glasses)
4. Garnish elaborately

Modern Bloody Marys often feature extravagant garnishes: celery, pickles, olives, shrimp, bacon, entire cheeseburgers—the sky's the limit.

### Bond's Bloody Mary

In *Thunderball* (1961), when Bond first encounters Domino, she orders a **double Bloody Mary with plenty of Worcester sauce**.

This specification reveals Domino's character: she's bold, direct, and appreciates strong flavors. The double makes it a serious drink, while the extra Worcestershire adds savory umami depth.

Bond himself orders a vodka and tonic with bitters—a lighter choice that allows him to keep his wits while Domino indulges more heavily.

## The Daiquiri: Cuba's Gift to the World

### Jennings Cox: The American Engineer

In the 1890s, American mining engineer Jennings Stockton Cox, Jr. worked near Daiquiri, Cuba—a beach town and iron mine site near Santiago de Cuba in eastern Cuba. (Daiquirí is a word of Taíno origin, from the indigenous people of the Caribbean.)

According to legend, Cox and his fellow workers mixed big pitchers of rum, lime, and sugar to combat the brutal Caribbean heat. One account suggests Cox ran out of gin when American guests visited, forcing him to improvise with available ingredients: rum, lime juice, and sugar.

### From Santiago to Havana

Expert Havana bartenders refined Cox's simple mixture into the treasured drink served today. Most likely, either Emilio González at the Plaza Hotel or Constantino Ribalaigua Vert at El Floridita transformed the rough Santiago recipe into an elegant cocktail.

Constantino "Constante" Ribalaigua made a career from the Daiquiri, creating numerous variations. He owned and operated El Floridita, Ernest Hemingway's favorite bar in Havana, and earned the title "dean of Cuban bartenders."

### The Hemingway Connection

Constante created the "Hemingway Daiquiri" (also called "Papa Doble") based on Hemingway's preferences:
- Double rum
- No sugar (Hemingway was diabetic)
- Grapefruit juice added
- Maraschino liqueur

Hemingway reportedly claimed his personal record was 16 double Daiquiris in one sitting—though given his legendary capacity for exaggeration, this figure should perhaps be taken with a grain of salt (or a wedge of lime).

### Going Global

The Daiquiri remained relatively local until 1909, when Rear Admiral Lucius W. Johnson, a U.S. Navy medical officer, tried Cox's drink and introduced it to the Army and Navy Club in Washington, D.C.

Prohibition turned Havana into a cocktail culture hotbed, with Americans flocking to Cuba for legal drinking. The Daiquiri became synonymous with Cuban sophistication and tropical escapism.

### Classic Daiquiri Recipe

**Ingredients:**
- 2 oz (60 ml) white rum
- 1 oz (30 ml) fresh lime juice
- 0.75 oz (22 ml) simple syrup

**Method:**
1. Fill cocktail shaker with ice
2. Add rum, lime juice, and simple syrup
3. Shake vigorously until well-chilled
4. Strain into chilled coupe glass

The result should be balanced: rum's sweetness, lime's tartness, and sugar's roundness in perfect harmony.

### Bond's Daiquiri

In *On Her Majesty's Secret Service* (1963), at Piz Gloria, Bond orders a Daiquiri for Violet.

This appears in the context of Bond's elaborate deception while undercover, where he must play the role of an effete genealogist. Ordering Daiquiris fits this persona while demonstrating Bond's cocktail knowledge.

### Frozen vs. Shaken

The classic Daiquiri is shaken and served "up" in a coupe glass. The frozen Daiquiri—blended with ice—became popular in the mid-20th century and remains common in beach bars and tourist destinations.

Cocktail purists generally prefer the shaken version, which they consider more elegant and better balanced. The frozen version tends toward sweetness and can mask inferior ingredients with icy texture.

## Gin & Tonic: Medicine Turned Pleasure

### The Malaria Problem

In early 19th-century India and other tropical British colonies, malaria posed a persistent, deadly threat to European colonizers and soldiers. Quinine, derived from the bark of the cinchona tree, was the only effective antimalarial treatment available.

The problem: quinine is extraordinarily bitter and unpleasant to drink.

### The British Solution

As early as 1825, British officers stationed in India began adding quinine to a mixture of water, sugar, lime, and gin to make the medicine more palatable. This wasn't recreational drinking—it was medical necessity made bearable.

The officers already received gin as part of their standard rations, making it a natural choice for mixing with quinine.

### Commercial Tonic Water

In 1858, Erasmus Bond patented the first commercial tonic water, creating a product specifically designed for quinine delivery.

In 1870, Schweppes introduced "Indian Quinine Tonic," explicitly marketing to the growing population of overseas British who needed daily quinine prophylaxis. The product's success established Schweppes as the dominant tonic water brand—a position it maintains today.

### From Medicine to Cocktail

What began as medicine evolved into pleasure. As quinine prophylaxis became less critical (with better antimalarial drugs developed), gin and tonic persisted as a refreshing, sophisticated drink divorced from its medicinal origins.

Modern tonic water contains far less quinine than 19th-century versions—enough for flavor, not enough for antimalarial effect. The drink's bitter note comes primarily from quinine, balanced by sugar and enhanced by carbonation.

### Classic Gin & Tonic Recipe

**Ingredients:**
- 2 oz (60 ml) gin
- 4-6 oz (120-180 ml) tonic water
- Lime wedge

**Method:**
1. Fill highball glass with ice
2. Add gin
3. Top with tonic water
4. Stir gently
5. Garnish with lime wedge

### Bond's Gin & Tonic

In *Dr. No* (1958), Bond orders a gin and tonic with a very specific preparation: adding **the juice of an entire lime**.

This specification makes sense in the Caribbean setting. The abundant lime juice provides tartness and freshness while honoring the drink's historical roots (lime was part of the original Indian preparation).

### Vodka Tonic

Bond orders vodka and tonic in several novels:
- **Goldfinger** (1959): "Vodka and tonic" at the bar
- **Thunderball** (1961): "Vodka and tonic with bitters" when meeting Domino
- **On Her Majesty's Secret Service** (1963): Four vodka and tonics consumed

The vodka tonic is a modern variation without the historical significance of gin and tonic. Vodka's neutral profile creates a cleaner, less botanical drink—suitable for those who find gin too assertive but still want the refreshing quality of tonic water.

# Chapter 5: British Traditions

## Pink Gin: The Royal Navy's Favorite

### Angostura Bitters: The Foundation

In 1824, Dr. Johann Gottlieb Benjamin Siegert, a surgeon in the Venezuelan town of Angostura (now Ciudad Bolívar), developed a medicinal bitter tonic to treat seasickness and stomach ailments. His "Angostura bitters" combined gentian, herbs, and spices in a concentrated formula.

The bitters proved remarkably effective and became standard medical supplies aboard ships, particularly in the Royal Navy.

### The Naval Innovation

Aboard ship, a surgeon and the ship's captain discovered that mixing a small amount of Angostura bitters with their gin ration created an agreeable pink drink. They served this creation to other officers, and "Pink Gin" quickly became popular throughout the Royal Navy.

The combination made sense on multiple levels:
1. Made bitter medicine more palatable
2. Used the gin already provided in naval rations
3. Created a distinctive drink that became part of naval culture

### From Sea to Shore

The Royal Navy brought Pink Gin to bars in England, where the drink was first noted on the mainland in the 1870s. This pared-back cocktail—just gin and bitters, sometimes with a twist—quickly became fashionable in gentlemen's clubs and bars.

Pink Gin represented understated British elegance: no frills, no fuss, just quality gin enhanced with aromatic bitters.

### Plymouth Gin: The Traditional Choice

While any gin can make a Pink Gin, **Plymouth Gin** became the traditional choice, particularly in naval circles. Plymouth Gin, produced at the Black Friars Distillery in Plymouth, England (established 1793), has a softer, slightly sweeter profile than London Dry gins.

The Plymouth connection made sense: Plymouth was (and remains) a major Royal Navy port, making Plymouth Gin the natural choice for naval officers.

### Serving Method

Traditional Pink Gin is served **warm and undiluted**—remarkable in cocktail culture, where ice is nearly universal.

A bartender may ask customers whether they want the bitters "in or out":
- **In**: The bartender swirls Angostura around the glass and leaves it in
- **Out**: The bartender swirls the bitters and pours it out, leaving only a residue coating the glass

Then the gin is added neat, without ice or water. Some modern versions add ice and water, but purists consider this inauthentic.

### Pink Gin Recipe

**Traditional:**
- 2 oz (60 ml) Plymouth gin
- 3-5 dashes Angostura bitters

**Method:**
1. Swirl bitters in a small wine glass or rocks glass
2. Pour out excess (or leave in, per preference)
3. Add gin
4. Serve at room temperature, no ice

**Modern variation:**
- Add ice
- Add a small amount of water
- Garnish with lemon twist

### Bond's Pink Gin

In *The Man With The Golden Gun* (1965), Fleming's final completed novel, Bond drinks Pink Gin.

This choice reflects Bond's connection to British naval and military traditions. Despite being in the Secret Service rather than the Navy, Bond's character embodies military discipline and British heritage—Pink Gin reinforces these associations.

### Cultural Displacement

The Horse's Neck became popular in Royal Navy wardrooms in the 1960s, displacing Pink Gin as the officers' preferred drink. This shift reflects broader cultural changes in British drinking habits and the decline of bitter drinks in favor of sweeter, longer cocktails.

---

## Horse's Neck: From Temperance to Tipple

### The Temperance Origins

The Horse's Neck dates to the late 1800s and early 1900s as a **non-alcoholic** drink. The earliest reference appears in the Fort Wayne, Indiana Journal on September 1, 1895.

The original recipe was simple:
- Ginger ale
- Ice
- Long spiral of lemon peel

This refreshing, non-alcoholic beverage aligned with the temperance movement's emphasis on sophisticated refreshments without intoxication. It could be served at soda fountains and social clubs without moral controversy.

### The "Kick"

By the 1910s, brandy or bourbon began appearing in the recipe, creating a "horse's neck with a kick" or "stiff horse's neck." The alcoholic version eventually became standard, though the non-alcoholic original never entirely disappeared.

### The Name

The name "Horse's Neck" derives from the distinctive garnish: the curled lemon peel spiral draped over the glass's edge. This spiral visually resembles the arched neck of a horse—an elegant flourish that became the drink's defining characteristic.

Cutting a proper horse's neck garnish requires skill: starting at one end of a lemon, cut the peel in a continuous spiral about 3/4 inch wide, creating a long, unbroken ribbon.

### Recipe Evolution

**Non-Alcoholic Horse's Neck:**
- 4-6 oz ginger ale
- Long spiral lemon peel
- Ice

**Horse's Neck with a Kick:**
- 2 oz brandy or bourbon
- 4-6 oz ginger ale
- Long spiral lemon peel
- Ice

**Method:**
1. Drape lemon peel spiral in a highball glass
2. Add ice
3. Add brandy or bourbon (if using)
4. Top with ginger ale
5. Stir gently

### Bond's Horse's Neck

The Horse's Neck appears in two Fleming works:

**On Her Majesty's Secret Service** (1963): Among Bond's 46 drinks in this novel, the Horse's Neck makes an appearance.

**Octopussy** (short story, 1966): Bond drinks a Horse's Neck in this later work.

These appearances come late in Fleming's writing career, suggesting the drink gained fashionability in the 1960s.

### The Royal Navy Revival

The Horse's Neck became popular in Royal Navy wardrooms in the 1960s, displacing Pink Gin as the officers' preferred drink. This shift represented changing tastes—from the austere Pink Gin to the longer, sweeter, more approachable Horse's Neck.

### Presidential Connection

American President Franklin D. Roosevelt supposedly favored the Horse's Neck, adding presidential cachet to this simple highball. FDR's preference would have aligned with the drink's American associations (bourbon/brandy, ginger ale) while maintaining sophistication.

## Black Velvet: Mourning Prince Albert

### December 14, 1861: A Nation Mourns

When Prince Albert, Queen Victoria's beloved Prince Consort, died of typhoid fever on December 14, 1861, Britain entered deep mourning. Queen Victoria wore black for the rest of her life, and the entire nation adopted mourning customs.

At Brooks's Club, a prestigious gentlemen's club in London, a bartender created a drink to match the national mood.

### "Even the Champagne Should Be in Mourning"

The bartender's innovation combined two beverages that represented different aspects of British life:

1. **Champagne**: Associated with celebration, luxury, and aristocracy
2. **Stout** (Guinness): Associated with the working class, Ireland, and everyday drinking

The resulting mixture—dark as mourning clothes—was christened the **Black Velvet**. It was said that "even the champagne should be in mourning."

### The Recipe

**Ingredients:**
- Equal parts champagne (or dry sparkling wine)
- Stout (traditionally Guinness)

**Method:**
1. Pour champagne into a champagne flute or tall glass
2. Slowly pour stout over an upside-down spoon held just above the champagne
3. The stout should layer on top, creating a dark top with lighter bottom
4. Some versions mix the two instead of layering

The layered version creates a striking visual effect, though the drink inevitably mixes as you drink it.

### The Flavor Profile

The Black Velvet creates an unexpectedly harmonious combination:

- Champagne's acidity and effervescence cut through stout's richness
- Stout's roasted, coffee-like notes complement champagne's fruitiness
- The result is less sweet than champagne alone, less heavy than stout alone

### Bond's Black Velvet

In *Diamonds Are Forever* (1956), the Black Velvet appears in Bond's adventures.

This choice reflects the drink's sophisticated British heritage while demonstrating Bond's adventurous palate. The Black Velvet isn't as commonly ordered as a Martini or even a Negroni, showing Bond's deep cocktail knowledge.

### Modern Status

Today, the Black Velvet is no longer exclusive to mourning. It appears on cocktail menus as a brunch option (combining champagne's traditional brunch role with stout's breakfast associations) and at Irish celebrations, particularly St. Patrick's Day.

The drink represents Victorian elegance and the British tradition of creating meaningful rituals around drinking—even in sorrow.

---

# Chapter 6: Bond's Champagne

## The Champagne Life

James Bond's relationship with champagne reflects Ian Fleming's own appreciation for the finest French bubbles. Across the novels, Bond consumes champagne regularly, demonstrating specific preferences that reveal both his sophistication and Fleming's personal tastes.

Bond's champagne choices aren't arbitrary. Each house represents history, quality, and specific flavor profiles that align with Bond's character: refined but not ostentatious, traditional yet discerning, British-aligned while internationally respected.

---

## Bollinger: The Royal Warrant

### Founded 1829: A Franco-German Partnership

On February 6, 1829, the company Renaudin-Bollinger & Cie was founded in Aÿ, Champagne, by three partners:
- Hennequin de Villermont (vineyard owner)
- Paul Renaudin (cellar master)
- Jacques Bollinger (sales expert)

### Jacques Bollinger: The German Nobleman

Jacques Bollinger was the son of German nobility who traveled to France to become a Champagne wine merchant. His story reveals the complexity of Champagne's history: Anthonse de Villermont inherited a prestigious estate in Aÿ from his sister, but as a member of the aristocracy, French law forbade him from engaging in commercial activity.

Villermont requested assistance from Joseph "Jacques" Bollinger, a specialist in Champagne sales, and Paul Renaudin, a Champagne native. The three became co-founders, with Bollinger handling sales and Renaudin responsible for the cellar.

### The Aÿ Terroir

Bollinger is based in the commune of Aÿ, renowned for producing exceptional Pinot Noir grapes. This location gives Bollinger champagnes their characteristic richness and complexity.

### Royal Warrant: 140 Years and Counting

The house has enjoyed a close association with Britain since 1858. In 1884, Queen Victoria awarded Bollinger its first Royal Warrant—official recognition as a supplier to the British Royal Family.

Bollinger has held a Royal Warrant continuously since 1884, marking an unbroken 140+ years of partnership with the Crown—an unprecedented achievement in Champagne. This distinction places Bollinger at the heart of British royal tradition.

### The British Connection

Despite being a French champagne house, Bollinger's British connections run deep:
- Preferred by the Royal Family
- Featured in James Bond novels
- Associated with British sophistication and tradition

### In the Fleming Novels

In *Diamonds Are Forever* (1956), Tiffany Case sends Bond a **quarter bottle of Bollinger** to his cabin on the RMS Queen Elizabeth, along with steak on toast canapés and Sauce Béarnaise.

This represents Bond's first literary encounter with Bollinger champagne. The quarter bottle (187ml) is the perfect size for one person—intimate and thoughtful, reflecting Tiffany's growing affection for Bond.

The Bollinger choice signals Tiffany's own sophistication: she selects a champagne with British royal connections, appropriate for seducing a British agent.

---

## Taittinger: Fleming's Favorite

### 1734: Forest-Fourneaux

The Taittinger Champagne house traces its roots to 1734, when Jacques Fourneaux established a wine business in Champagne, working closely with Benedictine abbeys that owned the finest vineyards in the region.

Originally named "Forest-Fourneaux," it became one of the oldest champagne houses—the third oldest in existence by the time Pierre Taittinger acquired it.

### Pierre Taittinger's Love Story

The house's modern history begins with a love story. During World War I, Pierre-Charles Taittinger served as a French officer. His command post was located at the Château de la Marquetterie, a magnificent property in Champagne.

Taittinger fell in love with the château and the region. In 1931, he and his brother-in-law acquired the venerable champagne firm of Forest-Fourneaux. In 1932, Pierre personally bought the Château de la Marquetterie from the wine house—the property that had captured his heart during the war.

### The Taittinger Family Background

The Taittingers were a family of wine merchants from Lorraine. In 1870, following the Franco-Prussian War and the Treaty of Frankfurt, they moved to the Paris region to retain their French citizenship—Lorraine had become German territory.

This detail adds poignancy to Pierre's story: a family that moved to remain French, with a son who fell in love with a château while defending France during war.

### Reims: The Champagne Capital

The Taittinger Champagne house is based in Reims, in the heart of the Champagne region. Reims, with its magnificent Gothic cathedral where French kings were crowned, represents the soul of Champagne production.

### Fleming's Personal Favorite

Ian Fleming personally favored Taittinger, and this preference appears throughout the Bond novels:

**Casino Royale** (1953): **Taittinger Blanc de Blanc Brut of 1943** appears, which Bond orders as room service, before later switching to Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin Brut.

**On Her Majesty's Secret Service** (1963): **Taittinger** appears among Bond's extensive drinking in this novel.

The 1943 vintage in *Casino Royale* is particularly notable—a wartime champagne, produced during the Nazi occupation of France. This vintage would have been made under extraordinarily difficult circumstances, adding historical resonance to Bond's choice.

---

## Dom Pérignon: The Monk's Legacy

### The Historical Figure (1638-1715)

Dom Pierre Pérignon was a French Benedictine monk who served as cellarer at the Abbaye Saint-Pierre d'Hautvillers from 1668 until his death in 1715. As cellarer, he was responsible for the abbey's wine production and storage.

### The Great Myth

Popular mythology credits Dom Pérignon with inventing sparkling Champagne and exclaiming, "Come quickly, I am tasting the stars!" when he first tasted the bubbles.

This story is almost entirely false.

The "tasting the stars" quote appears to have first appeared in a print advertisement in the late 19th century—over 150 years after Dom Pérignon's death. A major proponent of misconceptions was Dom Groussard, one of Dom Pérignon's successors at the Abbey, who in 1821 gave an embellished account of Dom Pérignon "inventing" Champagne to garner historical importance and prestige for the church.

### The Reality: Evolution, Not Invention

Sparkling wine had been produced in the Champagne region before Dom Pérignon's time. The region's wines were predominantly still and red during his era. Champagne did not become dominantly sparkling until the mid-19th century.

### His Actual Contributions

Dom Pérignon did make important contributions to wine quality:

1. **Blending**: He introduced extensive blending of grapes from multiple vineyards, creating more complex, balanced wines
2. **Quality Control**: He established rigorous standards for grape selection and wine production
3. **Technique**: He refined production methods, improving consistency and quality

These contributions were significant, even if he didn't "invent" sparkling Champagne.

### The Moët & Chandon Brand

The prestigious champagne **Dom Pérignon**, the prestige cuvée of Moët & Chandon, is named after the monk.

The brand's history:
- First vintage: 1921
- First released for sale: 1936
- Given by Champagne Mercier to Moët in 1927 for a wedding between the two families

Dom Pérignon represents the absolute pinnacle of Moët & Chandon's production—a vintage-dated champagne released only in exceptional years, aged for a minimum of seven years before release.

### In the Fleming Novels

**Moonraker** (1955): **Dom Pérignon 1946** accompanies Bond and M for dinner.

The 1946 vintage is particularly significant—the first full year of peace after World War II. M choosing this champagne for dinner with Bond suggests celebration, luxury, and perhaps acknowledgment of their shared wartime service.

Bond and M consume two bottles, indicating a long, leisurely meal and the close relationship between the two men—M is not just Bond's superior but something of a father figure.

---

## Veuve Clicquot: The Widow's Triumph

### Barbe-Nicole Ponsardin (1777-1866)

Born in 1777 to a textile manufacturer in Reims, Barbe-Nicole Ponsardin entered the champagne business through marriage. On June 10, 1798, she married François Clicquot, whose father Philippe had founded a champagne house in 1772.

### The Tragedy

François and Barbe-Nicole's marriage appeared happy, and François began learning the family champagne business. Then, in October 1805, seven years after their wedding, François fell suddenly ill with a fever similar to typhoid. He died within days, at age 30.

Barbe-Nicole was just 27 years old, widowed with a young daughter.

### "Veuve" Clicquot: The Business Decision

In an era when women were systematically excluded from the business world, the young widow ("veuve" in French) made an extraordinary decision: she would take control of her late husband's business.

She assumed the head of the company founded by her father-in-law in 1772, undertaking this role with passion and determination. She became one of the first businesswomen in France—and one of the most successful.

### Revolutionary Innovations

Madame Clicquot's creativity and drive led to multiple champagne innovations:

1. **The First Known Vintage Champagne**: Dating and marketing champagne by year of production
2. **The Riddling Table** (1816): A revolutionary device for clarifying champagne by gradually moving sediment to the bottle's neck for removal. This process continues to be used today.
3. **The First Known Blended Rosé Champagne**: Creating pink champagne through blending rather than skin contact

These weren't minor improvements—they fundamentally changed champagne production and quality.

### The Yellow Label

In the 1870s, the house innovated again by dressing its bottles in a **yellow label**—an unusual color for the time that made Veuve Clicquot bottles instantly recognizable.

The 'V.Clicquot P. Werlé' Yellow Label trademark was registered on February 12, 1877. It remains the oldest bottle bearing a yellow label kept in the Veuve Clicquot house collection.

Today, that iconic yellow label has become one of the most recognizable images in wine—synonymous with quality, celebration, and the champagne lifestyle.

### "La Grande Dame of Champagne"

Madame Clicquot's formidable contributions earned her the nickname "la grande dame of Champagne"—the great lady of Champagne. She transformed a small family business into an international powerhouse, all while overcoming the systematic barriers facing women in 19th-century business.

She died in 1866 at age 89, having built a champagne empire that bears her name to this day.

### In the Fleming Novels

**Casino Royale** (1953): **Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin Brut** appears after Bond initially orders Taittinger.

**Diamonds Are Forever** (1956): At the 21 Club in New York, Bond enjoys **Clicquot Rosé** champagne, which Fleming describes as having "the faint taste of strawberries."

This tasting note—strawberries—demonstrates Fleming's wine knowledge. Rosé champagnes often exhibit red fruit notes, and the strawberry description is both evocative and technically accurate.

Fleming's choice of Veuve Clicquot for Bond reflects the champagne's status: prestigious without being ostentatious, historically significant, associated with triumph over adversity (much like Bond himself), and representing the absolute peak of French luxury.

---

# Chapter 7: The Spirit Cabinet

## Bourbon: America's Native Spirit

### Kentucky's Gift to the World

Bourbon whiskey is America's only native spirit, with a history deeply rooted in Kentucky's limestone-rich water, corn-abundant agriculture, and pioneering distilling traditions.

To be labeled "bourbon," whiskey must meet specific legal requirements:
- Produced in the United States
- Made from a mash bill containing at least 51% corn
- Aged in new charred oak barrels
- Distilled to no more than 160 proof
- Entered into the barrel at no more than 125 proof
- Bottled at 80 proof or higher

### Bond's Bourbon Preferences

Bond demonstrates a clear preference for bourbon over Scotch whisky in the novels. Fleming's bourbon choices for Bond reveal careful consideration:

---

### Old Grand-Dad

**The Hayden Legacy:**
Old Grand-Dad was created by Basil Hayden, a distiller who made his name by distilling bourbon with a higher percentage of rye grain in the mash bill. Rye provides spicy, peppery notes that distinguish Old Grand-Dad from sweeter, corn-forward bourbons.

Basil Hayden passed the distilling art to his son, and then to his grandson—hence the name "Grand-Dad." The brand represents multi-generational expertise and tradition.

**In the Novels:**
In *Live and Let Die* (1954), Bond specifically requests **Old Grand-Dad bourbon** for his Old Fashioned cocktails on the Silver Phantom train.

This specification shows Bond's knowledge extends beyond cocktail construction to understanding base spirits. Old Grand-Dad's spicy character would stand up well in an Old Fashioned, maintaining complexity even when mixed with sugar and bitters.

---

### I.W. Harper

**Isaac Wolfe Bernheim's Dream:**
I.W. Harper was founded by German immigrant Isaac Wolfe ("I.W.") Bernheim, who arrived in America in 1848 with $4 and a dream. He eventually established his own distillery, producing I.W. Harper Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey.

The brand has a 150-year history and was relaunched in the United States in 2015 by Diageo after years of being available primarily for export.

**In the Novels:**
In *On Her Majesty's Secret Service* (1963), Bond consumes **half a pint of I.W. Harper bourbon** among his 46 drinks in this novel.

A half-pint represents serious drinking—about 8 ounces or 237 ml. This detail contributes to the portrait of Bond in this novel as a man drinking heavily, perhaps to cope with the emotional complexity of his undercover mission and developing relationship with Tracy.

---

### Jack Daniel's

**Tennessee Whiskey, Not Bourbon:**
Technically, Jack Daniel's is not bourbon—the brand proudly calls itself **Tennessee whiskey**. While it meets all the requirements for bourbon, it undergoes an additional process called the **Lincoln County Process**: filtering the new-make whiskey through sugar maple charcoal before barreling.

This extra step makes Jack Daniel's distinctive, giving it a smoother, slightly sweeter character than most bourbons.

**History:**
In 1875, Jack Daniel founded a legally registered distilling business with Dan Call, taking over shortly afterward when Call quit for religious reasons. The Jack Daniel Distillery in Lynchburg, Tennessee, became one of America's most iconic whiskey producers.

**In the Novels:**
Bond drinks **Jack Daniel's** in both *On Her Majesty's Secret Service* (1963) and *You Only Live Twice* (1964).

Fleming's choice of Jack Daniel's for Bond shows awareness of American whiskey beyond bourbon. The Tennessee whiskey's smoothness might appeal to Bond's refined palate while still providing the robust American character he appreciates.

---

### Bourbon in Cocktails

Bond consumes bourbon in various preparations:

- **Old Fashioned**: With Old Grand-Dad in *Live and Let Die*
- **Double Bourbon Old Fashioned**: In *Thunderball* before a nap
- **Bourbon and Waters**: Three in *On Her Majesty's Secret Service*
- **Double Bourbon on the Rocks**: Multiple occasions across novels
- **Neat Bourbon**: Throughout the series

This versatility shows bourbon's flexibility: sippable neat, refreshing with water or on rocks, complex enough for cocktails.

---

## Vodka: The Russian Revolution in a Bottle

### The Spirit of the Tsars

Vodka's origins trace to Eastern Europe, with both Russia and Poland claiming to have invented the spirit. The name derives from the Slavic word "voda" (water), with "vodka" meaning "little water."

Traditional vodka was made from potatoes, grains, or even grapes, distilled to high proof and filtered to create a neutral spirit.

### The Prohibition Opportunity

Vodka remained relatively obscure in America until the mid-20th century. The 1950s and 1960s saw vodka's explosion in popularity, particularly after the introduction of the Moscow Mule and as Americans sought "cleaner" spirits without whiskey's or gin's strong flavors.

### Bond's Vodka Preferences

Bond demonstrates sophisticated knowledge of vodka, including distinctions most drinkers never consider.

---

### Grain vs. Potato Vodka

In *Casino Royale* (1953), when specifying his Vesper recipe, Bond notes:

> "If you can get a vodka made with grain instead of potatoes, you will find it still better."

This distinction matters:

**Grain Vodkas** (wheat, rye, corn):
- Smoother, slightly sweeter
- Lighter mouthfeel
- Subtle bread or grain notes

**Potato Vodkas**:
- Creamier, fuller body
- Earthier character
- Slightly oily texture

Bond's preference for grain vodka reveals his refined palate—he can detect differences most drinkers wouldn't notice.

---

### Wolfschmidt

In *Moonraker* (1955), M orders a **carafe of Wolfschmidt vodka**.

In a memorable scene, Bond adds a theatrical touch: he drops a pinch of black pepper onto the surface of the vodka. This Polish tradition serves multiple purposes:
- The pepper oils create aromatic complexity
- Visual interest (pepper floats on vodka's surface)
- A conversation piece demonstrating cultural knowledge

### Vodka in Cocktails

Bond's vodka cocktails include:

- **Vesper Martini**: Vodka + gin + Kina Lillet
- **Vodka Martini**: 19 consumed across the novels
- **Vodka and Tonic**: Multiple occasions
- **Double Vodka Martini on the Rocks**: In *On Her Majesty's Secret Service* and *Goldfinger*

The vodka Martini became synonymous with Bond through the films, though Fleming's literary Bond drank slightly more gin Martinis (16) than vodka ones (19).

## Rum: Caribbean Sunshine

### The Sugar Trade

Rum's history is inseparable from the Caribbean sugar trade, colonialism, and the triangular trade that shaped the Atlantic world. Produced from sugarcane byproducts (molasses or sugarcane juice), rum became the spirit of sailors, pirates, and island life.

### Bond's Caribbean Adventures

Fleming set many Bond adventures in the Caribbean, particularly Jamaica, where Fleming owned Goldeneye estate. These settings naturally introduced rum into Bond's drinking repertoire.

### The Daiquiri

Bond's primary rum cocktail is the **Daiquiri**, which he orders for Violet in *On Her Majesty's Secret Service*.

The Daiquiri represents rum at its most elegant: white rum, fresh lime juice, and simple syrup, shaken and served in a coupe glass. This preparation highlights rum's sugarcane sweetness balanced against lime's tartness.

### Rum Varieties

The rum world includes remarkable diversity:

**White/Silver Rum**:
- Light-bodied, subtle flavor
- Ideal for Daiquiris and Mojitos
- Aged briefly or not at all

**Gold Rum**:
- Aged in barrels, picking up color and flavor
- Richer, more complex
- Suitable for sipping or mixing

**Dark Rum**:
- Heavily aged, full-bodied
- Rich molasses and caramel notes
- Often sipped neat

**Navy Strength Rum**:
- Higher proof (57% ABV)
- Historical association with British Royal Navy
- More intense flavor

### Fleming's Jamaica Connection

Fleming's personal connection to Jamaica influenced Bond's character. The tropical setting, rum culture, and Caribbean sophistication appear throughout the novels, particularly in *Dr. No*, *The Man with the Golden Gun*, and *Live and Let Die*.

# Afterword: Drinking Like Bond

James Bond's relationship with alcohol is complex and, by modern standards, concerning. Fleming wrote in an era when heavy drinking was more socially acceptable and less understood medically.

Bond's consumption—92 units weekly—would today be recognized as problematic. Yet within Fleming's fictional world, Bond's drinking serves multiple purposes:

1. **Character Development**: Demonstrates sophistication, worldliness, appreciation for quality
2. **Cultural Commentary**: Reflects 1950s-60s British upper-class drinking culture
3. **Tension Relief**: Shows Bond's coping mechanisms for stress and danger
4. **Sensory Detail**: Provides rich descriptive opportunities for Fleming's prose

For readers interested in exploring these cocktails, moderation is key. The recipes in this book represent some of the finest cocktails ever created—meant to be appreciated, savored, and enjoyed responsibly.

Bond's world is fantasy. His drinking, while fascinating to study, shouldn't be emulated. Instead, appreciate these drinks as historical artifacts, cultural touchstones, and examples of cocktail artistry at its finest.

Here's to cocktails enjoyed with sophistication, knowledge, and moderation.

*Cheers.*
