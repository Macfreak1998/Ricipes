# Chapter 9: Low-ABV & Aperitifs - The Art of Restraint

Not every occasion calls for strength. Sometimes you want conversation to last, afternoons to stretch, evenings to unfold slowly. Low-ABV cocktails—built on fortified wines, bitters, and liqueurs—provide sophisticated drinking without the intensity of spirit-forward drinks.

The aperitif tradition, strongest in Italy and France, centers on this philosophy. Pre-dinner drinks should stimulate appetite, not impair it. They should invite second rounds without consequences. The twelve drinks here embody this wisdom.

## The Aperitivo Tradition

Italy's aperitivo culture represents civilized drinking at its finest. Starting around 6 PM, Italians gather at cafés for low-alcohol drinks accompanied by small bites. The practice builds community, marks the transition from work to evening, and prepares the palate for dinner.

Vermouth—aromatized, fortified wine—sits at the heart of this tradition. Italian vermouths (both sweet/red and dry) combined with bitter liqueurs (Campari, Aperol) and various modifiers create infinite possibilities without excessive alcohol.

The spritz format—bitter liqueur, sparkling wine, soda—has conquered the world. But older traditions (the Americano, the various vermouth cocktails) offer equal elegance with more history.

## The Drinks

## Classics

### Americano

The Negroni's ancestor—gentle bitterness and modest strength making it ideal for extended drinking.

**Recipe:**
- 1 oz Campari
- 1 oz sweet vermouth
- Soda water to top
- Orange slice for garnish

Build in highball glass over ice. Top with soda.

The Americano emerged in 1860s Milan when Gaspare Campari combined his eponymous bitter with sweet vermouth and soda. Originally called the "Milano-Torino" (Campari from Milan, vermouth from Turin), it became "Americano" due to popularity among American tourists. The Americano was James Bond's first drink in Ian Fleming's novels (*Casino Royale*, 1953).

### Bamboo

Sherry and vermouth creating surprising depth—nutty, dry, aromatic, predating the Martini.

**Recipe:**
- 1.5 oz dry vermouth
- 1.5 oz fino sherry
- 2 dashes Angostura bitters
- 1 dash orange bitters
- Orange peel for garnish

Stir with ice. Strain into chilled coupe. Express orange peel.

This cocktail dates to 1886, with bartender Louis Eppinger credited through his work in Yokohama. The Bamboo demonstrates that elegant cocktails need not include base spirits. Orange bitters add complexity.

---

### Chrysanthemum

Dry vermouth, Bénédictine, and absinthe creating an aperitif of remarkable sophistication.

**Recipe:**
- 2 oz dry vermouth
- 1 oz Bénédictine
- 3 dashes absinthe
- Orange twist for garnish

Stir with ice. Strain into chilled coupe. Express orange twist.

Hugo Ensslin's 1916 *Recipes for Mixed Drinks* introduced this vermouth-forward cocktail. The drink's revival followed absinthe's 2007 re-legalization in the United States. Modern bartenders appreciate its herbal complexity.

---

### Adonis

A sweeter counterpart to the Bamboo—sherry and sweet vermouth with orange bitters.

**Recipe:**
- 1.5 oz fino sherry
- 1.5 oz sweet vermouth
- 2 dashes orange bitters
- Orange peel for garnish

Stir with ice. Strain into chilled coupe. Express orange peel.

Named for the 1884 Broadway musical, the Adonis predates the cocktail revival by over a century.

### Sherry Cobbler

One of the 19th century's most popular drinks—wine, sugar, fruit representing cocktail construction at its simplest.

**Recipe:**
- 3 oz amontillado sherry
- 1/2 oz simple syrup
- 3 orange slices
- Seasonal fruit for garnish
- Mint sprig for garnish

Muddle orange with syrup. Add sherry and crushed ice. Swizzle to frost glass.

The Sherry Cobbler helped establish cocktail culture in America. Served over crushed ice with fresh fruit, it predates the cocktail shaker and was originally sipped through newfangled drinking straws.

### Vermouth Cocktail

Before vermouth became merely a modifier, it anchored its own drinks—sophisticated drinking in the late 1800s.

**Recipe:**
- 2 oz sweet vermouth (or dry, or half-and-half)
- 2 dashes Angostura bitters
- 1 barspoon simple syrup (optional)
- Cherry or lemon twist for garnish

Stir with ice. Strain into chilled coupe.

This simple preparation—vermouth with bitters and perhaps sugar—represented sophisticated drinking in the late 1800s.

### White Noise

Cocchi Americano meets elderflower liqueur and soda—a refreshing low-alcohol crowd-pleaser.

**Recipe:**
- 1.5 oz Cocchi Americano
- 1 oz elderflower liqueur
- 2 oz soda water
- Grapefruit twist for garnish

Build in highball glass over ice. Stir gently. Express grapefruit peel over surface.

Portland Hunt + Alpine Club created this refreshing aperitif. The grapefruit twist is essential—oils expressed over the drink's effervescence carry aromatic impact.

### Hugo

Tyrolean spritz variation—elderflower, prosecco, and mint for summer refreshment.

**Recipe:**
- 1 oz elderflower syrup
- Fresh mint leaves
- 4 oz prosecco
- 2 oz soda water
- Mint sprig for garnish
- Lime slice for garnish

Build in wine glass with ice. Add elderflower syrup, mint, prosecco, and soda. Stir gently.

Created in 2005 at a bar in South Tyrol, the Hugo spread throughout Europe as an alternative to heavier aperitivi.

### Limoncello Spritz

Italian lemon liqueur with prosecco and soda—sweeter than Aperol Spritz, appealing to those who find bitter aperitivi challenging.

**Recipe:**
- 2 oz limoncello
- 3 oz prosecco
- 1 oz soda water
- Lemon slice for garnish
- Rosemary sprig for garnish

Build in wine glass over ice. Stir gently.

The logical combination of Italian lemon liqueur with prosecco and soda.

---

### Garibaldi

Campari and "fluffy" orange juice—high-speed blending creates something greater than the sum of parts.

**Recipe:**
- 1.5 oz Campari
- 4 oz fresh orange juice (fluffy)
- Orange slice for garnish

Blend orange juice until frothy. Build in highball over ice.

Named for Giuseppe Garibaldi, who united Italy, this simple combination requires one secret: aerated OJ, achieved through high-speed blending that incorporates air.

---

### Campari Spritz

The original bitter spritz—more complex and challenging than its orange Aperol cousin.

**Recipe:**
- 4 oz prosecco
- 2 oz Campari
- 1 oz soda water
- Orange slice for garnish

Build in wine glass over ice. Add prosecco, then Campari, then soda.

Campari's intensity makes this the sophisticated choice, predating Aperol's softer version.

---

### 2-2

Aperol and a full ounce of absinthe—converting Aperol skeptics through herbal intensity.

**Recipe:**
- 1.5 oz Aperol
- 1 oz absinthe
- 1 oz fresh lemon juice
- 1/4 oz simple syrup
- 6 dashes orange bitters
- Flamed orange peel for garnish

Shake with ice. Strain into chilled coupe. Flame orange peel over surface and discard.

This modern creation from @she_thebartender boldly combines Aperol with absinthe. Six dashes of orange bitters and a flamed orange peel tie everything together.

## Beyond These 12: The Low-ABV Landscape

Low-ABV drinking continues growing as consumers seek sophistication without impairment. The drinks here provide starting points; endless variations await.

**Sherry Exploration:** The Bamboo and Adonis demonstrate sherry's cocktail potential. Experiment with different styles: fino for dry applications, amontillado for depth, oloroso for richness, Pedro Ximénez for sweetness.

**Vermouth as Star:** Quality vermouth deserves center stage. Explore producers like Cocchi, Carpano, Punt e Mes, and Dolin in vermouth-forward drinks.

**Spritz Creativity:** Beyond Aperol lies endless possibility. Try Select, Cynar, Montenegro, or other amari in the spritz format.

**Session Cocktails:** For extended drinking, any spirit-based drink can be diluted with more mixer, lengthened with soda, or split with vermouth to reduce intensity.

The art lies in balance. These twelve drinks prove that restraint can be as rewarding as strength.
