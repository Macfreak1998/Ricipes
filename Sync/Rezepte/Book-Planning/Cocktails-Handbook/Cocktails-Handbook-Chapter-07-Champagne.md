# Chapter 7: Champagne & Sparkling - The Celebratory Spirit

Champagne transforms occasions. Its effervescence signals celebration, its pop announces arrival, its bubbles lift whatever they touch. In cocktails, sparkling wine adds texture, lightness, and festivity that still spirits cannot replicate.

This chapter covers drinks that rely on champagne, prosecco, or other sparkling wines as primary components. Some are simple builds—sparkling wine elevated with a single modifier. Others are complex constructions where champagne provides the finishing flourish. All share the quality of feeling special, of marking moments worth remembering.

The eleven drinks here range from brunch staples to late-night indulgences, from Italian aperitivo culture to American innovation. They prove that bubbles belong in cocktails as surely as in flutes.

## The Effervescent Story: History of Sparkling Wine Cocktails

Champagne has been mixed with other ingredients almost since its creation. The méthode champenoise—the secondary fermentation that creates those famous bubbles—was understood by the late 17th century. By the mid-19th century, cocktails featuring champagne appeared regularly in bartenders' guides.

**The Golden Age**

Jerry Thomas included the Champagne Cocktail in his 1862 *Bar-Tender's Guide*—a sugar cube soaked in bitters, topped with champagne. The format established a template: something sweet, something aromatic, topped with bubbles. The drink became synonymous with luxury, appearing in high society gatherings and eventually in Hollywood films like *Casablanca*.

The French 75 emerged from World War I—named, supposedly, for the powerful French 75mm field gun, because the drink "hits with similar force." It combined gin, lemon, and sugar with champagne, creating one of the most enduring champagne cocktails.

**Post-War Evolution**

The Bellini arrived in 1948 at Harry's Bar in Venice, combining prosecco with white peach purée. Giuseppe Cipriani named it for the soft pink tones in Giovanni Bellini's Renaissance paintings. The drink epitomized Italian elegance and helped establish prosecco as a cocktail ingredient distinct from champagne.

The Mimosa—champagne and orange juice—became a brunch institution by the 1960s. Its origins remain disputed (Frank Meier at the Ritz Paris in 1925 gets frequent credit), but its cultural position is secure. The Mimosa made champagne cocktails accessible, acceptable at breakfast, and fundamentally democratic.

**Modern Movements**

The Aperol Spritz transformed European drinking culture in the 2010s. The drink existed since the 1950s, but Campari's marketing campaigns after acquiring Aperol in 2003 made it a global phenomenon. The "3-2-1" ratio became instantly recognizable; the orange drink in wine glasses became visual shorthand for European vacation.

Social media accelerated innovation. The Frozen Aperol Spritz went viral on TikTok in 2024, adapting a sophisticated aperitivo into a slushy summer drink. The Sbagliato—a "mistaken" Negroni with prosecco instead of gin—became famous after a viral celebrity interview. Champagne cocktails proved surprisingly adaptable to digital culture.

## Understanding Sparkling Wines

**Champagne**

True Champagne comes only from the Champagne region of France, produced using méthode champenoise (secondary fermentation in bottle). Its high acidity and fine bubbles make it ideal for cocktails—it cuts through sweetness and provides lift without overwhelming other ingredients.

For mixing, non-vintage brut works best. Save vintage and prestige cuvées for drinking straight; their subtleties disappear in cocktails.

**Prosecco**

Italian prosecco uses the Charmat method (secondary fermentation in tank), creating softer bubbles and a gentler, fruitier profile than champagne. It's generally sweeter, less acidic, and less expensive—making it the default choice for many sparkling cocktails.

Prosecco suits the Bellini, Aperol Spritz, and similar Italian-inspired drinks. Its softer character integrates differently than champagne's assertive bubbles.

**Cava and Others**

Spanish cava uses méthode champenoise but typically at lower price points than champagne. Crémant (French sparkling wine from regions outside Champagne) offers similar value. For cocktails where champagne character matters but budget doesn't stretch to actual Champagne, these alternatives perform well.

## The Bubbles Shelf

**Prosecco (Essential):** The workhorse of sparkling cocktails. Choose brut or extra-dry (confusingly, extra-dry is slightly sweeter than brut). Avoid the sweetest styles for cocktails.

**Non-Vintage Brut Champagne (Recommended):** When the recipe specifically calls for champagne, or when you want that particular acidity and minerality. Moët & Chandon Impérial, Veuve Clicquot, or Taittinger Brut provide reliable quality.

**Crémant or Cava (Budget Alternative):** For high-volume situations or casual occasions. These provide bubbles and festivity at lower cost.

### Aperol Spritz

The embodiment of Italian aperitivo culture—low-alcohol, pre-dinner drinking meant to stimulate appetite and conversation.

**Recipe:**
- 3 oz prosecco
- 2 oz Aperol
- 1 oz soda water
- Orange slice for garnish

Build in wine glass over ice. Add prosecco first, then Aperol, then soda. Stir gently.

The drink dates to the 1950s in Venice and the Veneto region, though the "spritz" concept originated with Austrian soldiers diluting Italian wines during the Habsburg occupation. Aperol itself was created in 1919 by the Barbieri brothers in Padua—a bitter orange aperitif with rhubarb and gentian. The drink remained regional until Campari's 2003 acquisition launched global marketing campaigns built around the "3-2-1" ratio. The Aperol Spritz became the drink of European summers, representing la dolce vita in a single sip.

### Bellini

Prosecco and white peach purée creating a drink whose soft pink-orange color evokes Renaissance painting.

**Recipe:**
- 3 oz prosecco
- 2 oz white peach purée

Add peach purée to chilled champagne flute. Slowly top with prosecco, stirring gently to integrate.

Giuseppe Cipriani created the Bellini at Harry's Bar in Venice in 1948—though some sources suggest 1934-1947. The color reminded Cipriani of tones in Giovanni Bellini's Renaissance paintings. The Bellini was seasonal initially, available only when white peaches were ripe. Its popularity eventually demanded year-round availability, leading to various purée and juice substitutes. Purists insist on fresh white peaches; pragmatists accept quality frozen purée. Harry's Bar became a legend partly through this drink, drawing celebrities and aristocrats who spread its reputation worldwide.

### Kir Royale

Champagne elevated with crème de cassis—a wartime improvisation transformed into sophisticated celebration.

**Recipe:**
- 1 barspoon crème de cassis
- Champagne to top

Add cassis to champagne flute. Top slowly with champagne.

Canon Félix Kir, a Catholic priest and mayor of Dijon during World War II, created the original Kir to boost morale when Nazis confiscated red wine. His combination of white Burgundy wine with crème de cassis (blackcurrant liqueur) mimicked red wine's appearance. After the war, French bartenders elevated the drink by substituting champagne for white wine, creating the Kir Royale. The drink remains a symbol of French resilience and hospitality.

### Mimosa

America's brunch cocktail—champagne and fresh orange juice that made sparkling wine acceptable at breakfast.

**Recipe:**
- 1.5 oz fresh orange juice
- Champagne to top

Pour orange juice into champagne flute. Top carefully with champagne.

The Mimosa's origin involves competing claims—Frank Meier at Paris's Ritz Hotel around 1925, or evolution from London's Buck's Fizz (1921). The difference between Mimosa and Buck's Fizz lies in proportions: Buck's Fizz uses twice as much champagne as juice; the Mimosa approaches equal parts. Whatever its origin, the Mimosa became America's brunch cocktail by the 1960s. It democratized sparkling wine and established a tradition that persists today. Fresh-squeezed orange juice makes a significant difference here.

### Champagne Cocktail

Celebration in its purest form—a sugar cube soaked in bitters, topped with champagne, releasing streams of bubbles.

**Recipe:**
- 1 sugar cube
- 6-8 dashes Angostura bitters
- Champagne to top
- Lemon twist for garnish

Place sugar cube in champagne flute. Saturate with bitters. Top slowly with champagne. Express lemon twist over surface and drop in.

Jerry Thomas published this recipe in 1862, making it one of the oldest champagne cocktails on record. The simplicity belies its impact—as the sugar dissolves, it gradually sweetens the drink. The Champagne Cocktail appeared in *Casablanca* and *An Affair to Remember*, cementing its glamorous image. Brandy appeared in later versions, though the original contained none.

### Death in the Afternoon

Hemingway's creation—absinthe and champagne in surprisingly harmonious combination, anise notes lifted by bubbles.

**Recipe:**
- 1 oz absinthe
- Champagne to top

Pour absinthe into champagne flute. Slowly top with chilled champagne until the drink turns milky opalescent.

Ernest Hemingway created this drink and contributed the recipe to a 1935 celebrity cocktail book. His instructions: "Pour one jigger absinthe into a Champagne glass. Add iced Champagne until it attains the proper opalescent milkiness. Drink three to five of these slowly." The name references Hemingway's 1932 book about bullfighting. The drink reflects his personality—bold, simple, potentially dangerous. His recommendation to drink "three to five" should be approached with caution.

### Seelbach

Bourbon, Cointreau, extensive bitters, and champagne creating remarkable complexity—Kentucky meets France.

**Recipe:**
- 1 oz bourbon
- 1/2 oz Cointreau
- 7 dashes Angostura bitters
- 7 dashes Peychaud's bitters
- Champagne to top
- Orange twist for garnish

Build bourbon, Cointreau, and bitters in champagne flute. Top with champagne.

The Seelbach originated at Louisville's Seelbach Hotel, allegedly in the 1920s—though its discovery and popularization came much later when bartender Adam Seger "found" the recipe in hotel archives in the 1990s. Questions about its authenticity persist, but the drink's quality is undeniable. The seven dashes each of Angostura and Peychaud's sound excessive but prove essential—they balance bourbon's sweetness against champagne's acidity.

### Prince of Wales

Gilded Age indulgence—champagne, cognac, Bénédictine, and bitters suited to aristocratic social scenes.

**Recipe:**
- 1 sugar cube
- 2 dashes Angostura bitters
- 3/4 oz cognac
- 1/4 oz Bénédictine
- Champagne to top
- Orange wedge for garnish
- Cherry for garnish

Place sugar cube in highball glass. Saturate with bitters. Add ice cube. Pour in cognac. Top with champagne. Float Bénédictine on top.

Albert Edward, Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII), reportedly created this cocktail himself at private events in the late 19th century. The earliest recipe appeared in an anonymous 1901 biography. The original recipe included various elements (pineapple, maraschino); this version focuses on the core combination. It's rich and complex.

### Ritz

Cognac, orange liqueur, citrus, and champagne—a celebration cocktail with substance and style.

**Recipe:**
- 3/4 oz cognac
- 1/4 oz Cointreau
- 3/4 oz fresh orange juice
- Champagne to top

Shake cognac, Cointreau, and orange juice with ice. Strain into champagne flute. Top with champagne.

Dale DeGroff created this cocktail in 1985 at New York's Aurora, later featuring it at the Rainbow Room. His inspiration came from cocktails associated with the London and Paris Ritz hotels—he designed a "Ritz Cocktail for New York." The combination creates something greater than its parts.

### Frozen Aperol Spritz

The sophisticated Italian aperitivo transformed into a slushy phenomenon—amplified refreshment with vibrant orange appeal.

**Recipe:**
- 4 oz Aperol
- 4 oz fresh orange juice
- 4 oz prosecco
- 2 cups ice
- Orange wheel for garnish

Blend all ingredients until smooth and slushy. Pour into wine glass.

The Frozen Aperol Spritz went viral on TikTok in summer 2024. The viral version uses equal parts rather than the classic 3-2-1 ratio—simpler to remember, easier to make at home. The bright orange color becomes even more vibrant when blended. The trend reflects how classic cocktails adapt to social media age: frozen formats, visual appeal, low-ABV options for extended drinking, and recipes simple enough for home preparation.

### Sbagliato

A "mistaken" Negroni—prosecco instead of gin creating lighter, effervescent bitter-sweet character.

**Recipe:**
- 1 oz Campari
- 1 oz sweet vermouth
- Prosecco to top
- Orange slice for garnish

Build Campari and vermouth in rocks glass over ice. Top with prosecco. Stir gently.

"Sbagliato" means "mistaken" in Italian—legend holds that a bartender accidentally grabbed prosecco instead of gin while making a Negroni. The "mistake" proved delicious. The drink existed quietly for decades before going viral in 2022 when actress Emma D'Arcy mentioned it in an interview. Suddenly "Negroni Sbagliato... with prosecco in it" became a global meme and genuine cocktail trend. The Sbagliato offers Negroni's bitter-sweet character without the same alcohol intensity—an aperitivo that extends rather than ends conversations.

## Beyond These 11: Continuing Your Sparkling Journey

Champagne cocktails reward exploration beyond these classics.

**The French 75 Family:** The French 75 (gin, lemon, sugar, champagne) appears in the Gin chapter, but variations abound. The French 76 substitutes vodka. The French 77 uses elderflower liqueur. The template—spirit, citrus, sweet, bubbles—accommodates endless modification.

**Bellini Variations:** Swap peach purée for other fruits—raspberry (Rossini), strawberry (Rossini variation), pear. The format works with any fruit that purées smoothly.

**Spritz Exploration:** Beyond Aperol, try Campari Spritz (more bitter), Select Spritz (Venetian tradition), Cynar Spritz (artichoke liqueur). The spritz format accommodates various Italian aperitivi.

**Champagne as Topper:** Many cocktails benefit from a champagne float. Add bubbles to punch, to sours, to spirit-forward drinks that need lift. The technique extends beyond traditional champagne cocktails.

**Serving Considerations:** Champagne cocktails require attention to temperature. Keep all components cold. Chill glasses. Don't let drinks sit—effervescence fades quickly. Serve immediately after preparation.

The bubbles that define this chapter do more than provide texture—they transform mood. A still drink is pleasant; a sparkling drink is celebratory. These eleven cocktails provide vocabulary for celebration. When you deploy them determines what you're celebrating.
