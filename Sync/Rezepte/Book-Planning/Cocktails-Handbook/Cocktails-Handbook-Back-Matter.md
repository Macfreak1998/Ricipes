## Glossary of Terms

**ABV (Alcohol by Volume):** The percentage of alcohol in a liquid. A 40% ABV spirit contains 40% pure alcohol.

**Amaro (pl. Amari):** Italian bitter liqueurs, typically herbal and bittersweet. Ranges from light (Aperol) to intensely bitter (Fernet-Branca).

**Aromatic Bitters:** Concentrated botanical extracts used in dashes. Angostura is the most common; others include Peychaud's and various orange bitters.

**Build:** To construct a drink directly in the serving glass rather than mixing separately.

**Chilling:** Reducing drink temperature through contact with ice. Proper chilling is essential for palatability.

**Coupe:** A shallow, stemmed glass with a wide bowl. The modern standard for most shaken cocktails.

**Crusta:** A drink style featuring a sugar-crusted rim and a long spiral of citrus peel lining the glass.

**Dash:** A small quantity of liquid, typically bitters. Approximately 1/32 oz or 10-12 drops.

**Dilution:** Water added to a cocktail through melting ice during preparation. Essential for balance; typically 20-30% of final volume.

**Double Strain:** Straining through both a Hawthorne strainer and a fine-mesh strainer to remove all particles.

**Dry:** Less sweet. A "dry" Martini uses less vermouth; "dry" vermouth is less sweet than "sweet" vermouth.

**Express:** To squeeze citrus peel over a drink to release aromatic oils, then optionally drop it in.

**Falernum:** A Caribbean syrup or liqueur flavored with lime, almond, ginger, cloves, and sometimes vanilla.

**Float:** To layer an ingredient on top of a drink by pouring gently over the back of a spoon.

**Fortified Wine:** Wine strengthened with added spirit. Includes vermouth, sherry, port, and Madeira.

**Free Pour:** Measuring by count or feel rather than using a jigger. Discouraged for precision.

**Garnish:** Decorative and aromatic additions to finished drinks. Functional garnishes add flavor; decorative ones add visual appeal.

**Hawthorne Strainer:** A strainer with a spring coil that fits over shaker tins.

**Jigger:** A measuring device for liquids, typically with two different-sized cups.

**Julep Strainer:** A perforated spoon-like strainer designed to fit inside a mixing glass.

**Muddle:** To crush ingredients to release flavors. Technique varies by ingredient.

**Neat:** A spirit served at room temperature without ice or mixers.

**On the Rocks:** Served over ice.

**Orgeat:** An almond-flavored syrup, essential for Mai Tais and other tiki drinks.

**Overproof:** Spirits with higher-than-standard alcohol content, typically above 50% ABV.

**Proof:** A measurement of alcohol content. In the U.S., proof = 2 x ABV (e.g., 80 proof = 40% ABV).

**Rinse:** Coating the inside of a glass with a small amount of spirit (often absinthe), then discarding the excess.

**Rocks Glass:** A short, wide tumbler for spirit-forward drinks. Also called an Old Fashioned glass.

**Roll:** To pour a drink back and forth between two vessels to mix without excessive aeration.

**Shake:** To vigorously agitate ingredients with ice in a sealed shaker. Chills, dilutes, and aerates.

**Simple Syrup:** Equal parts sugar and water, dissolved. The standard cocktail sweetener.

**Sour:** A cocktail formula combining spirit, citrus, and sweetener.

**Split Base:** Using two or more spirits as the drink's foundation.

**Stir:** To gently mix ingredients with ice using a bar spoon. Chills and dilutes without aeration.

**Straight Up:** Shaken or stirred with ice, then strained into a glass without ice.

**Swizzle:** A technique using a pronged stick rolled between the palms to mix and chill drinks.

**Tiki:** A cocktail movement featuring tropical ingredients, elaborate presentations, and Polynesian-inspired aesthetics.

**Top:** To add a final ingredient, typically carbonated, after other components are combined.

**Twist:** A piece of citrus peel, expressed for oils and used as garnish.

**Vermouth:** Aromatized, fortified wine. Available in dry (white), sweet (red), and blanc (white, sweet) styles.

**Whip Shake:** A brief shake with crushed ice to chill without excessive dilution.

## About the Recipes

All recipes in this handbook have been tested and standardized using the following conventions:

**Measurements** are in U.S. fluid ounces. See conversion chart for metric equivalents.

**"Fresh" citrus juice** means squeezed within hours of use. Bottled juice produces inferior results in virtually all applications.

**Ice** refers to standard freezer cubes unless otherwise specified. Large cubes, crushed ice, and pebble ice are called for when they matter.

**Glassware suggestions** are recommendations, not requirements. Any appropriate vessel works.

**Garnishes** serve both functional and aesthetic purposes. Those listed contribute to the drinking experience; feel free to adjust for personal preference or availability.
