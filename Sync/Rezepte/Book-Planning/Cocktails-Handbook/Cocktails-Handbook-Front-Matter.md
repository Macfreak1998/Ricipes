## A Note to the Reader

This handbook contains 150 cocktails organized by primary spirit across ten chapters. The progression within each chapter moves from simpler preparations to more complex ones—not because easy drinks are lesser, but because foundations support advancement.

Every recipe has been tested. Measurements are precise. Techniques are explained. What remains is practice.

The best cocktail is the one you make for someone you care about, in the moment they need it. Technical perfection matters less than generous intention. Make these drinks for yourself, for friends, for strangers who become friends. The recipes are merely starting points.

Welcome to the craft.
