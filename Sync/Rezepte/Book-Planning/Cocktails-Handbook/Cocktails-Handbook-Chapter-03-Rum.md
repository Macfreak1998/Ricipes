# Chapter 3: Rum - The Caribbean Soul

Rum carries the Caribbean in every sip—sugarcane fields under tropical sun, colonial histories both celebrated and troubled, island rhythms and seaside ease. No spirit category spans such diversity: from the crisp, light rums of Puerto Rico to the funky, ester-rich expressions of Jamaica; from the grassy agricole rhums of Martinique to the dark, molasses-heavy rums of Demerara. To learn rum is to learn an archipelago's worth of styles, traditions, and techniques.

This diversity makes rum simultaneously accessible and inexhaustible. A Mojito demands only basic white rum and fresh mint. A properly constructed Mai Tai requires understanding how different rum styles interact. The spectrum between these drinks represents a lifetime of exploration.

## A Spirit Born of Empire

Rum's history is inseparable from the history of sugar—and the brutal plantation system that produced it. When European colonizers established sugarcane cultivation in the Caribbean in the seventeenth century, they discovered that molasses, the dark syrup left after sugar crystallization, could be fermented and distilled into a potent spirit. The earliest rums were rough, harsh, and produced primarily for the enslaved workers who labored in the cane fields.

The British Royal Navy institutionalized rum consumption in 1655, when Admiral Penn's fleet captured Jamaica and began issuing rum rations to sailors. The daily "tot" continued until 1970—over three centuries of naval tradition. Rum became currency in the triangular trade connecting Europe, Africa, and the Americas, its commerce fueled by human bondage.

By the nineteenth century, rum production had refined considerably. Column stills enabled lighter, cleaner spirits. Spanish colonial islands—Cuba, Puerto Rico—developed elegant white rums suited for mixing. British colonial islands maintained traditions of heavier, more characterful expressions. French islands, working from fresh-pressed cane juice rather than molasses, created the distinctive agricole style.

The American cocktail revolution embraced rum enthusiastically. Pre-Prohibition bartenders featured it in classics from the Daiquiri to various punches. During Prohibition, Americans flooded into Havana, discovering Cuban bartending culture and bringing its drinks back when the law changed. The tiki movement of the 1930s and 1940s—pioneered by Donn Beach and Trader Vic—transformed rum into something exotic, complex, and theatrical.

Mid-century decline hit rum as it hit all cocktails. The spirit became associated with overly sweet, artificially flavored concoctions—the "boat drink" cliché. Serious rum, like serious cocktails generally, retreated to the margins.

The craft cocktail revival has restored rum's reputation. Bartenders now approach rum with the same seriousness they apply to whiskey or gin. Agricole rhums command respect. Aged expressions receive attention previously reserved for cognac. The Daiquiri, properly made, is recognized as one of the world's perfect drinks. Rum has emerged from its boat-drink exile, and the category has never been more exciting.

## Understanding Rum Styles

Rum's diversity can overwhelm newcomers. Understanding the major styles helps navigate the category and select appropriate bottles for specific drinks.

**White/Light Rum** provides the foundation for most rum cocktails. These rums are either unaged or aged briefly and filtered to remove color. Spanish-style white rums (Bacardí, Don Q, Havana Club) tend toward clean neutrality. Jamaican white rums retain more character despite their clarity. For Mojitos, Daiquiris, and most shaken rum drinks, a quality white rum from Puerto Rico or Cuba sets the standard.

**Gold/Aged Rum** spends time in barrels, gaining color and complexity. The aging period varies enormously—some gold rums see only months in wood, others rest for years. Spanish-style aged rums (añejo) emphasize smoothness and vanilla. British-style aged rums retain more of rum's natural funk. These rums work beautifully in spirit-forward preparations like the Old Fashioned or El Presidente.

**Dark Rum** is a broad category encompassing heavily aged rums, rums with added color, and particularly robust expressions. Gosling's Black Seal, essential for the Dark 'n' Stormy, exemplifies the style. Jamaican dark rums like Myers's or Appleton bring intensity to tiki drinks. The darkness often comes from caramel coloring as much as barrel aging—read labels carefully.

**Jamaican Rum** deserves separate mention for its distinctive character. Jamaican distilleries traditionally use pot stills and long fermentations, producing rums rich in esters—chemical compounds that create the "funky," overripe-fruit notes prized by tiki enthusiasts. Smith & Cross, Appleton, and Hampden Estate exemplify the style. A little Jamaican rum transforms blended tiki drinks.

**Demerara Rum** comes from Guyana's Demerara region and offers deep, molasses-rich character with notes of burnt sugar and tropical fruit. El Dorado is the major producer. Demerara rums anchor many classic tiki recipes and provide backbone in rum blends.

**Rhum Agricole** from the French Caribbean (Martinique, Guadeloupe) is distilled from fresh sugarcane juice rather than molasses. The result tastes distinctively grassy, vegetal, and bright—closer to tequila's relationship with agave than to molasses-based rum. Agricole is essential for the Ti' Punch and brings unique character to modern rum cocktails.

**Overproof Rum** exceeds the standard 40% ABV, sometimes dramatically—Wray & Nephew is 63%, and navy strength rums typically reach 57%. These rums provide intensity in tiki drinks without excessive dilution and add punch when floated atop other cocktails.

**Cachaça**, Brazil's national spirit, is technically distinct from rum under Brazilian law but shares rum's sugarcane origin. Made from fresh cane juice like agricole, cachaça has its own character—slightly funky, grassy, distinctively Brazilian. The Caipirinha demands it; nothing else will do.

## Easy

### Mojito

The Mojito may be the world's most popular rum cocktail—and one of the most frequently botched. Done right, it's a masterpiece of refreshment. Done wrong, it's a muddled, overly sweet mess.

**Recipe:**
- 2 oz White Rum
- 3/4 oz fresh lime juice
- 1/2 oz simple syrup
- 8-10 fresh mint leaves
- Soda water to top
- Mint sprig and lime wheel for garnish

Gently muddle mint leaves with simple syrup and lime juice in a highball glass—press to release oils, don't pulverize. Add rum and stir. Fill with crushed ice. Top with soda water. Stir gently to integrate. Garnish with mint sprig and lime wheel.

The Mojito's origins trace to sixteenth-century Havana. The earliest form, called "El Draque," was named after Sir Francis Drake, the English privateer. In 1586, Drake's crew reportedly suffered from scurvy and dysentery; a concoction of aguardiente (crude rum), mint, lime, and sugar was thought to alleviate symptoms. As rum production developed, rum replaced aguardiente, and the drink evolved into the Mojito known today.

The name's etymology remains debated. It may derive from the African word "mojo," meaning "to place a spell," referencing the drink's perceived medicinal qualities. Others connect it to the Spanish "mojar" (to wet) or to mojo, a traditional Cuban lime-based seasoning.

Ernest Hemingway famously enjoyed Mojitos at La Bodeguita del Medio in Havana. The drink's global popularity exploded in the early 2000s, making it ubiquitous—and often poorly executed. The key is restraint with muddling (gentle pressing, not destruction), quality rum, and fresh mint.

---

### Cuba Libre

"Free Cuba"—the toast that named a nation's cocktail. Rum, cola, lime: simple ingredients with significant history.

**Recipe:**
- 1 1/2 oz White Rum
- 2 lime wedges
- Cola to fill

Muddle lime wedges in a highball glass. Add ice, then rum. Top with cola and stir briefly. Garnish with lime wheel.

The Cuba Libre originated in Havana around 1900, shortly after Cuba gained independence from Spain following the Spanish-American War. Coca-Cola had just begun importing to Cuba, making this combination possible for the first time. A widely accepted story credits a U.S. Army Signal Corps captain who, celebrating Cuba's victory, mixed Cuban rum with Coca-Cola and lime, then raised his glass with the revolutionary cry: "¡Por Cuba Libre!"

The lime distinguishes a Cuba Libre from a generic rum and Coke—it provides tartness that balances the cola's sweetness and connects the drink to its Cuban origins. Without lime, you're just drinking rum and Coke. With it, you're participating in history.

### Dark 'n' Stormy

A trademark dispute in a glass. The Dark 'n' Stormy isn't just a drink—it's Gosling Brothers' registered intellectual property, and legally, the name can only apply to drinks made with Gosling's Black Seal rum.

**Recipe:**
- 1 1/2 oz Gosling's Black Seal Rum
- 1/2 oz fresh lime juice
- Ginger beer to top
- Lime wheel for garnish

Build lime juice and ginger beer in a highball glass over ice. Float dark rum on top by pouring over the back of a bar spoon. Garnish with lime wheel.

The story begins in Bermuda after World War I at the Royal Naval Officers Club. British sailors, who drank ginger beer to settle seasickness, began mixing it with Gosling's Black Seal rum. A sailor observing the drink's layered appearance—dark rum floating over pale ginger beer—reportedly remarked it looked like "a cloud only a fool or a dead man would sail under."

Gosling Brothers has actively protected their trademark, pursuing legal action against establishments using other rums under the Dark 'n' Stormy name. Call it a "Rum Buck" or a "Stormy Weather" if you're using different rum—but Gosling's Black Seal genuinely works best here, its molasses-heavy character complementing ginger's spice perfectly.

### Piña Colada

The Piña Colada divides opinion. Detractors dismiss it as a tourist trap in liquid form. Advocates recognize it as a genuinely delicious drink when made properly—and Puerto Rico's official national cocktail since 1978.

**Recipe:**
- 2 oz Puerto Rican Rum
- 1 oz cream of coconut (Coco López)
- 1 oz heavy cream
- 6 oz pineapple juice
- Cherry and pineapple for garnish

Blend all ingredients with ice until smooth. Pour into a hurricane glass or tiki mug. Garnish with cherry and pineapple.

The name means "strained pineapple" in Spanish. The modern drink's creation is disputed among multiple claimants:

Ramón "Monchito" Marrero allegedly created it in 1954 at the Caribe Hilton Hotel in San Juan, using the newly available Coco López cream of coconut. Ricardo Garcia, another Caribe Hilton bartender, claims 1953. Ramón Portas Mingot insists he invented it in 1963 at Barrachina Restaurant.

Whoever deserves credit, the Piña Colada became iconic—helped considerably by Rupert Holmes' 1979 hit song "Escape" (the "Piña Colada Song"). The drink works because coconut and pineapple together create something greater than either alone, while rum provides the alcoholic backbone that prevents excessive sweetness.

---

### Daiquiri

The Daiquiri is the most important rum cocktail—and among the most important cocktails, period. Three ingredients, perfect balance, infinite nuance. Every bartender should master it.

**Recipe:**
- 1 1/2 oz White Rum
- 3/4 oz fresh lime juice
- 1/2 oz simple syrup

Shake with ice. Double strain into a chilled coupe. Garnish with lime wheel.

Jennings Cox, an American mining engineer working near Santiago de Cuba, likely created the Daiquiri around 1898. The drink takes its name from Daiquirí, a beach and iron mine in the region—itself a Taíno word. Cox improvised the drink for guests using readily available rum, limes, and sugar, adding crushed ice for refreshment.

The Daiquiri's simplicity obscures its difficulty. The balance between rum, lime, and sugar must be precise—too sweet or too tart ruins the drink. Temperature matters: shake hard, strain immediately, serve cold. Rum selection matters: a flavorful white rum shows its character here.

Constantino Ribalaigua Vert at Havana's El Floridita refined the Daiquiri across decades, developing variations including the Frozen Daiquiri. Hemingway was a regular, as was President Kennedy. The Daiquiri's reputation suffered mid-century when frozen, artificially flavored versions proliferated. The craft cocktail renaissance restored the classic preparation to prominence.

## Intermediate

### Caipirinha

Brazil's national cocktail demands Brazil's national spirit. The Caipirinha is not a rum drink—cachaça is its own category—but its sugarcane origins and technique earn it a place in this chapter.

**Recipe:**
- 2 oz Cachaça
- 1 lime, quartered
- 2 barspoon superfine sugar 

Muddle lime quarters and sugar in a rocks glass. Add cachaça. Fill with crushed ice and stir to integrate.

The Caipirinha likely originated around 1918 as a medicinal remedy during the Spanish flu pandemic. The initial concoction included cachaça, lime, garlic, and honey to alleviate symptoms. Over time, garlic and honey gave way to sugar and ice, creating the classic cocktail.

The name derives from "caipira," Portuguese for someone from rural Brazil—roughly translatable as "little redneck" or "country bumpkin." The Brazilian government officially declared the Caipirinha the national cocktail in 2003.

Cachaça's grassy, slightly funky character makes it irreplaceable here. Don't substitute white rum—the drink will taste different and lesser. The muddling technique matters: press firmly to extract juice and oils, but don't shred the lime into pieces.

---

### Mai Tai

The Mai Tai stands as tiki's most famous creation—and its most debased. The tourist version, laden with pineapple juice and artificial flavors, bears no resemblance to the original. Made properly, the Mai Tai is complex, balanced, and genuinely great.

**Recipe:**
- 2 oz aged Jamaican rum (or blend of dark and overproof)
- 3/4 oz fresh lime juice
- 1/2 oz dry curaçao
- 1/4 oz orgeat
- 1/4 oz simple syrup
- Lime shell and mint sprig for garnish

Shake with crushed ice. Pour unstrained into a rocks glass or tiki mug. Garnish with spent lime shell and mint sprig.

Victor Bergeron (Trader Vic) claims creation in 1944 at his Oakland, California restaurant. According to his story, he made the drink for Tahitian friends, who tasted it and exclaimed "Mai Tai Roa Ae!"—Tahitian for "Out of this world—the best!" The original recipe used 17-year-old Jamaican rum, lime, orgeat, orange curaçao, and simple syrup.

Donn Beach contested Bergeron's claim, noting he'd created similar drinks years earlier. The legal and historical dispute continues, though Bergeron retained the rights to the name.

The Mai Tai's genius lies in orgeat—almond syrup that provides body and nuttiness without overt sweetness. Quality orgeat transforms the drink; artificial versions diminish it. The rum should have character: Jamaican funk, not neutral Spanish-style rum.

---

### El Presidente

The "aristocrat of cocktails"—Cuba's elegant answer to the Manhattan. El Presidente demonstrates rum's sophistication in spirit-forward preparations.

**Recipe:**
- 1 1/2 oz aged Cuban-style rum
- 1 1/2 oz dry vermouth
- 1/4 oz dry curaçao
- 1 barspoon grenadine
- 1 dash Angostura bitters
- Orange peel for garnish

Stir with ice for 30 seconds. Strain into a chilled coupe. Express orange peel over the surface.

The cocktail honors a Cuban president—either Mario García Menocal (president 1913-1921) or Gerardo Machado (1920s). A 1919 article in the *New York Evening Telegram* first described it, suggesting the Menocal attribution. Bartender Eddie Woelke at the Jockey Club in Havana may have created it.

El Presidente gained popularity during Prohibition, when Americans visited Cuba for legal drinking. Society correspondent Basil Woon deemed it the "aristocrat of cocktails." After mid-century decline, the craft cocktail revival rediscovered and reinterpreted this elegant Cuban classic.

---

### Old Cuban

Audrey Saunders created the Old Cuban in 2001 at New York's Pegu Club, marrying the Mojito's Cuban flavors with Champagne's French elegance. It's a modern classic that has earned its place among the established greats.

**Recipe:**
- 1 1/2 oz aged rum
- 1 oz fresh lime juice
- 3/4 oz simple syrup
- 2 dashes Angostura bitters
- 6-8 fresh mint leaves
- Champagne to top
- Mint leaf for garnish

Shake rum, lime juice, simple syrup, bitters, and mint with ice. Double strain into a chilled coupe. Top with Champagne. Garnish with mint leaf.

Saunders initially called it "El Cubano." The "Old" in the final name specifically references the aged rum—a crucial component that provides depth and character the drink requires. The combination pays homage to classic Cuban cocktails while the Champagne introduction echoes the French 75.

The Old Cuban demonstrates that new classics can emerge from thoughtful combination of proven elements. Mint, lime, and rum connect to Cuba's cocktail heritage; Champagne elevates the drink to celebration status; bitters add complexity absent from the simpler Mojito.

---

### Planter's Punch

The Planter's Punch follows a famous formula: "One of sour, two of sweet, three of strong, four of weak." This rhyme—lime juice, sugar, rum, water—has guided punch-making since the earliest published recipe appeared in London in 1878.

**Recipe:**
- 2 oz dark Jamaican rum
- 3/4 oz fresh lemon juice
- 1/4 oz grenadine
- 2 3/4 oz orange juice
- Orange wedge, cherry, and nutmeg for garnish

Shake all ingredients with ice. Strain into a highball glass over fresh ice. Garnish with orange wedge and cherry. Grate nutmeg over top.

The Planter's Punch originated in Jamaica in the late 1800s. "Planter" referred to plantation owners who enjoyed rum punch on their verandas. The Myers's Rum Company championed the drink, and it gained international recognition after World War II through tiki culture.

No single definitive recipe exists—variations abound. Some add pineapple juice. Some float overproof rum. Some insist on lime rather than lemon. The formula remains the constant: balance sour, sweet, strong, and weak elements to create something refreshing and substantial.

---

### Rum Runner

The Rum Runner pays tribute to Prohibition-era smugglers who transported illegal alcohol through the Florida Keys. The drink itself emerged decades later, from the same tropical territory.

**Recipe:**
- 1 oz white rum
- 1 oz dark rum
- 2 3/4 oz pineapple juice
- Juice of half a lime
- 1 barspoon simple syrup
- Dash Angostura bitters
- Nutmeg for garnish

Shake all ingredients with ice. Strain into a highball glass over crushed ice. Grate nutmeg over top.

John "Tiki John" Ebert created the Rum Runner in the early 1970s at the Holiday Isle Tiki Bar (now Postcard Inn) in Islamorada, Florida Keys. Ebert devised it to utilize excess rum and various liqueurs—the original included banana and blackberry liqueurs, which many modern recipes retain.

The drink became a Florida Keys staple, appearing on tiki bar menus throughout the region. Its name honors the rum runners of Prohibition—smugglers who transported illegal alcohol by water between Cuba and Florida, establishing routes that bootleggers would use for decades.

---

### Hemingway Special

Also called the Hemingway Daiquiri or Papa Doble, this variation accommodates Ernest Hemingway's famous preferences: less sugar, more rum, added grapefruit.

**Recipe:**
- 1 1/2 oz white rum
- 3/4 oz maraschino liqueur
- 1 oz fresh grapefruit juice
- 1/2 oz fresh lime juice

Shake with ice. Strain into a chilled coupe. Garnish with lime wheel.

The drink originated at El Floridita in Havana, where Hemingway was a regular in the 1930s. Hemingway, who disliked overly sweet drinks, initially requested the house Daiquiri modified: less sugar, double rum. This became the "Papa Doble."

The recipe evolved further with grapefruit juice and maraschino liqueur additions, creating the Hemingway Special. The grapefruit's bitterness and maraschino's cherry-almond notes replace simple syrup's sweetness, producing a tart, complex drink that reflected Hemingway's adventurous palate.

---

### Airmail

Rum, lime, honey, Champagne—the Airmail combines elements of the Daiquiri, the Bee's Knees, and the French 75 into something distinctly its own.

**Recipe:**
- 1 oz aged rum
- 1/2 oz fresh lime juice
- 1/2 oz honey syrup (1:1)
- 1 1/2 oz Champagne

Shake rum, lime juice, and honey syrup with ice. Double strain into a Champagne flute. Top with Champagne.

The Airmail appeared in a 1930 Bacardí promotional pamphlet, coinciding with the establishment of regular airmail service in Cuba, including flights between Key West and Havana. The name references the then-revolutionary airmail postal service—before widespread telephone, airmail was the fastest international communication method.

W.C. Whitfield featured the drink in his 1941 book "Here's How," famously remarking it "ought to make you fly high." The cocktail sometimes featured a postal stamp as garnish, emphasizing its aviation theme. After mid-century obscurity, craft cocktail bars have revived this elegant, effervescent classic.

## Advanced

### Navy Grog

Donn Beach transformed the simple British naval rum ration into an elaborate tiki creation, blending three rum styles with citrus and honey for complexity that rewards attention.

**Recipe:**
- 1 oz Demerara rum
- 1 oz white rum
- 1 oz dark Jamaican rum
- 3/4 oz fresh lime juice
- 3/4 oz fresh grapefruit juice
- 1 oz honey syrup (2:1)
- Soda water to top
- Lime and mint for garnish

Shake rums, juices, and honey syrup with ice. Strain into a tiki mug or rocks glass over ice. Top with soda. Garnish with lime and mint.

The original "grog" dates to 1740, when Vice Admiral Edward Vernon—nicknamed "Old Grog" for his grogram coat—ordered sailors' rum rations diluted with water to prevent overindulgence. Donn Beach elaborated this simple mixture into something exotic in the 1940s.

Beach dedicated his Navy Grog initially to "gallant men of the American navy," later broadening to all navies. The three-rum blend creates layers of flavor: Demerara's molasses depth, white rum's clean brightness, Jamaican rum's funky complexity. The honey and citrus integrate these elements while soda lightens the drink for extended enjoyment.

---

### Test Pilot

Donn Beach created the Test Pilot in the 1930s, naming it for the era's aviation heroes breaking altitude and speed records. The drink itself requires navigating considerable complexity.

**Recipe:**
- 1 1/2 oz dark Jamaican rum
- 3/4 oz white rum
- 1/2 oz Cointreau
- 1/2 oz falernum
- 1/2 oz fresh lime juice
- 2 dashes Angostura bitters
- 6 drops Pernod (or absinthe)

Flash blend (brief blend with crushed ice) or shake vigorously. Pour into a tiki mug. Garnish elaborately.

Donn Beach frequently altered his recipes, creating multiple Test Pilot versions. Tiki historian Jeff "Beachbum" Berry documented a circa-1941 recipe calling for Jamaican dark rum, Puerto Rican light rum, Cointreau, Pernod, lime juice, falernum, and bitters. The Pernod-and-bitters combination was a Beach signature.

Trader Vic published his own adaptation in 1972. Competitors created versions called "Jet Pilot." The Test Pilot represents tiki at its most elaborate—multiple rums, multiple modifiers, precise technique—delivering complexity that rewards every sip.

---

### Beachcomber

The Beachcomber offers relative simplicity within the tiki canon—rum, citrus, orange liqueur, and maraschino create something elegant and refreshing.

**Recipe:**
- 2 oz white rum
- 3/4 oz fresh lime juice
- 1/2 oz Cointreau
- 1/4 oz maraschino liqueur

Shake with ice. Strain into a chilled coupe. Garnish with lime wheel.

The Beachcomber emerged in the early 1930s, gaining popularity during Prohibition when rum flowed freely. Its creation is disputed between Donn Beach and Trader Vic—both claimed versions, and the exact originator remains unclear.

The drink demonstrates that tiki needn't mean complexity. Four ingredients, properly balanced, create something greater than elaboration could achieve. The maraschino provides depth without sweetness; the Cointreau bridges lime and rum; the white rum lets the modifiers shine. It's a masterclass in restraint within a category known for excess.

---

## The Rum Shelf

Rum demands more variety than vodka but less than you might fear. Strategic selections cover enormous ground.

**Essential bottles:**
- White rum (Plantation 3 Stars, Bacardí Superior, or Havana Club 3)
- Aged rum (Appleton Estate Signature, El Dorado 8, or Plantation 5 Year)
- Dark Jamaican rum (Appleton Estate, Myers's, or Smith & Cross)
- Cachaça (Leblon or Novo Fogo) for Caipirinhas
- Gosling's Black Seal for Dark 'n' Stormys

**For serious tiki exploration:**
- Demerara rum (El Dorado 8 or Hamilton 86)
- Overproof rum (Wray & Nephew or Hamilton 151)
- Rhum agricole blanc (Rhum J.M or Clément)
- Falernum (John D. Taylor's Velvet Falernum)
- Orgeat (Small Hand Foods or homemade)

## Beyond These 16: Continuing Your Rum Journey

The drinks in this chapter establish rum's range—from simple refreshment to tiki complexity, from Cuban elegance to tropical excess. But rum's possibilities extend far beyond these foundations.

### More Drinks to Discover

**The Zombie** is Donn Beach's most famous creation—a potent blend of multiple rums, citrus, and secret ingredients that Beach allegedly limited to two per customer. Versions proliferate; the original recipe remained secret for decades.

**The Hurricane** became Pat O'Brien's New Orleans legend—passion fruit, citrus, and rum served in the distinctive hurricane lamp glass. It's transformed from serious cocktail to tourist trap and back again.

**The Jungle Bird** emerged from the Kuala Lumpur Hilton in 1978, combining rum with Campari—a bitter element unusual in tiki drinks. Its rediscovery sparked renewed interest in tiki's global variations.

**The Painkiller** comes from the Soggy Dollar Bar in the British Virgin Islands—rum, cream of coconut, pineapple, and orange juice served over ice. Pusser's Rum trademarked the name, creating another rum trademark dispute.

**The Ti' Punch** is Martinique's essential drink—rhum agricole, lime, and cane syrup in proportions the drinker adjusts personally. It's the simplest expression of agricole's distinctive character.

### Understanding Rum Blends

Tiki drinks often call for rum blends—combinations of different styles that create complexity no single rum achieves. Understanding how rums interact opens creative possibilities.

A typical tiki blend might combine:
- Light rum for clean sweetness
- Jamaican rum for funky complexity
- Demerara rum for molasses depth
- Overproof rum for intensity

The proportions vary by drink and preference. Experiment with your favorites—substitute different rums, adjust ratios, notice how each element contributes to the whole.

### The Agricole Difference

If you've only experienced molasses-based rum, agricole will surprise you. The fresh cane juice base produces a spirit closer to tequila's relationship with agave—grassy, vegetal, bright. Try a Ti' Punch to experience agricole's essence, then experiment with agricole substitutions in familiar drinks.

### A Living Tradition

Rum connects us to Caribbean history—the beautiful and the brutal. Every Daiquiri echoes Havana's golden age. Every tiki drink channels mid-century American escapism. Every sip carries sugarcane's journey from field to glass.

The 16 drinks in this chapter span centuries and continents, from Drake's sixteenth-century sailors to Audrey Saunders' twenty-first-century Pegu Club. They demonstrate rum's extraordinary range and its essential place in cocktail culture. Master these, explore further, and discover why rum remains the Caribbean's greatest gift to drinking culture.
