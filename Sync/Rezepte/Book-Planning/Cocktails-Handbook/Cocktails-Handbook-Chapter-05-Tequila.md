# Chapter 5: Tequila & Mezcal - The Agave Revolution

No spirit has undergone a more dramatic transformation in cocktail culture than tequila. Within living memory, it was the stuff of regrettable shots—cheap, harsh, something to endure rather than enjoy. Today, premium tequilas command the respect once reserved for aged Scotch and fine cognac. Mezcal, tequila's smoky cousin, has emerged from obscurity to become the spirit of choice for adventurous bartenders worldwide.

This revolution reflects changing tastes and improving quality. Modern tequila production has embraced craft methods, longer aging, and careful attention to terroir. What arrives in your glass bears little resemblance to the harsh spirits that gave the category its unfortunate reputation.

The fifteen drinks in this chapter trace agave spirits from classic Mexican cocktails to cutting-edge modern creations. From the iconic Margarita to Phil Ward's Division Bell, they demonstrate both tequila's versatility and mezcal's distinctive character.

## Blue Fire: The History of Agave Spirits

The story of tequila begins long before European contact. Indigenous peoples of central Mexico fermented the sap of agave plants into pulque, a mildly alcoholic beverage, for thousands of years. When Spanish conquistadors arrived in the 16th century, they brought distillation technology and a thirst for spirits stronger than pulque could provide. The marriage of European technique and Mexican raw materials created mezcal—and eventually, its most famous variety, tequila.

**The Birth of Tequila**

All tequila is mezcal, but not all mezcal is tequila. The distinction lies in geography and variety: tequila must be produced in designated regions (primarily the state of Jalisco) and made exclusively from blue Weber agave. Mezcal can come from various regions and use any of dozens of agave varieties.

The town of Tequila in Jalisco gave the spirit its name. By the late 18th century, commercial production had begun, and the first license for tequila production was granted to José María Guadalupe de Cuervo in 1795. The Cuervo distillery remains one of the largest today.

Tequila evolved through the 19th and 20th centuries, with quality varying widely. The worst examples—mixto tequilas made with only 51% agave and supplemented with cane sugar—fueled the spirit's poor reputation abroad. Better examples remained largely in Mexico, where tequila held deep cultural significance.

**The American Discovery**

Tequila crossed the border consistently by the mid-20th century, but usually not in its best form. The Margarita emerged sometime in the 1930s or 1940s—the exact origin remains disputed—but it spread primarily through Mexican border towns and eventually to American bars. The frozen Margarita machine, invented in 1971, turned the drink into a mass-market phenomenon, though often with cheap mixto tequila and artificial mixes.

The Tequila Sunrise found fame in the 1970s after Mick Jagger discovered it during the Rolling Stones' 1972 tour. The Eagles wrote a song about it; Jose Cuervo printed the recipe on bottles. This was tequila entering pop culture—not yet respected, but undeniably popular.

**The Premium Revolution**

The transformation began in the 1990s as 100% agave tequilas gained market share. Producers recognized that quality-focused consumers would pay premium prices for superior spirits. New expressions emerged: extended aging, innovative cask treatments, estate-grown agave. Celebrities discovered that tequila brands could be lucrative investments; more importantly, they brought attention to craft production.

By the 2010s, tequila had achieved genuine respectability. The category grew faster than any other spirit segment. Premium expressions outsold cheap mixtos. Bartenders stopped hiding tequila behind sweetness and began showcasing it in spirit-forward drinks.

**Mezcal's Emergence**

While tequila conquered the mainstream, mezcal built a cult following. Artisanal mezcal production—often using traditional methods like pit-roasting agave hearts and clay-pot distillation—created spirits with extraordinary complexity. The smokiness came from those roasting pits, where piñas cooked over wood fires for days before fermentation.

Phil Ward, opening Mayahuel in New York in 2007, demonstrated that mezcal could anchor sophisticated cocktails. The Division Bell, the Oaxaca Old Fashioned, and similar drinks showed bartenders a new palette of flavors to explore. By the mid-2010s, mezcal appeared on serious cocktail menus worldwide.

Today, both spirits continue evolving. Tequila production faces sustainability challenges as demand outpaces agave supply. Mezcal grapples with how to scale artisanal methods without sacrificing quality. The dialogue between tradition and innovation continues.

## Understanding Agave Spirits

**Tequila Categories**

Tequila comes in several expressions, each with different applications:

*Blanco* (or silver/plata) is unaged or rested briefly (up to 60 days). This is tequila in its purest form—the agave character comes through clearly, with vegetal, citrus, and pepper notes. Blancos make the best Margaritas and most fresh cocktails.

*Reposado* ("rested") ages 2-12 months in oak. The wood softens agave's edges and adds vanilla, caramel, and spice notes. Reposados work beautifully in aged-spirit cocktails like Old Fashioneds or where you want some oak influence.

*Añejo* ages 1-3 years, developing deeper color and more pronounced wood character. These are sipping tequilas first, but they can work in spirit-forward cocktails.

*Extra Añejo* ages more than 3 years. These are typically too expensive and nuanced for mixing.

Always look for "100% agave" on labels. Mixto tequilas (which can contain up to 49% non-agave sugars) produce inferior results in cocktails.

**Mezcal Character**

Mezcal's signature smoke comes from roasting agave hearts in underground pits lined with hot rocks. This process caramelizes sugars while infusing the piñas with wood smoke. The intensity varies by producer and agave variety.

*Espadín* is the most common agave variety in mezcal, accounting for roughly 90% of production. It offers reliable quality and balanced smoke—a good starting point for cocktails.

*Tobalá*, *Tobaziche*, *Madrecuixe*, and other wild varieties produce more complex, often more expensive mezcals. These are typically better appreciated neat than in cocktails.

For mixing, choose mezcals with moderate smoke that won't overwhelm other ingredients. Save the most distinctive expressions for sipping.

## The Agave Shelf

Building an agave collection starts with versatility:

**Blanco Tequila (Essential):** The foundation of tequila cocktails. Choose a 100% agave expression with clean agave flavor and good citrus notes. Espolón, Olmeca Altos, and Cimarron offer excellent cocktail performance at reasonable prices. Save Fortaleza or Siete Leguas for more showcase applications.

**Reposado Tequila (Recommended):** When you want more depth. The Tommy's Margarita often benefits from reposado's complexity. The same producers making good blancos typically make good reposados.

**Mezcal (Recommended):** Start with a moderately smoky espadín-based mezcal. Del Maguey Vida, Banhez, or Montelobos provide accessible entry points. Once you understand the category, explore producers like Vago, Rey Campero, or El Jolgorio.

## Easy

### Margarita

The world's most popular cocktail—tequila, lime, and orange liqueur in perfect balance.

**Recipe:**
- 2 oz blanco tequila
- 3/4 oz fresh lime juice
- 3/4 oz Cointreau
- Salt rim and lime wheel for garnish

Shake with ice. Double strain into chilled coupe or rocks glass with fresh ice. Salt rim optional—half-rim allows choice.

The Margarita is perhaps the most debated cocktail origin. Dozens of people claim credit, and the truth likely involves independent creation at multiple Mexican border establishments between the 1930s and 1950s. The name means "daisy" in Spanish, and the drink may have evolved from the Brandy Daisy. By the 1950s, the Margarita had arrived in American consciousness, appearing in *Esquire* magazine in 1953. The frozen Margarita machine (1971) expanded reach while often sacrificing quality. The craft cocktail revival restored the drink to its proper form.

### Paloma

Mexico's true national cocktail—tequila, lime, and grapefruit soda in a refreshing highball.

**Recipe:**
- 2 oz blanco tequila
- 1/2 oz fresh lime juice
- Pinch of salt
- 4-6 oz grapefruit soda (Squirt or similar)
- Lime wheel for garnish

Build in highball glass over ice. Add tequila and lime juice. Top with grapefruit soda. Stir gently.

While Americans drink Margaritas, Mexicans drink Palomas. The name means "dove" in Spanish, possibly referring to the folk song "La Paloma" or the drink's pale color. Origins are murky; Don Javier Delgado Corona of La Capilla is sometimes credited, though he denied it. The combination makes perfect sense: grapefruit's bitterness tempers tequila's intensity while lime provides acid balance.

**Note:** For a fresh version, substitute 2 oz fresh grapefruit juice plus 2 oz soda water for the grapefruit soda.

---

### Tequila Sunrise

Visual drama in a glass—grenadine sinks through orange juice, creating the gradient sunrise effect.

**Recipe:**
- 2 oz blanco tequila
- 4 oz fresh orange juice
- 1/2 oz grenadine
- Orange slice and cherry for garnish

Build in highball glass. Add tequila and orange juice over ice. Slowly pour grenadine down the inside of the glass—it will sink and rise, creating the sunrise effect. Don't stir.

The Tequila Sunrise exists in two forms. The original, created at the Arizona Biltmore Hotel in the 1930s or 40s, combined tequila with crème de cassis, lime, and soda. The modern version emerged from Sausalito's Trident bar in the early 1970s. Mick Jagger discovered it during the Rolling Stones' 1972 American tour. The band's enthusiasm spread the drink worldwide; Jose Cuervo began printing the recipe on bottles in 1973.

---

### Batanga

Don Javier's legendary creation—tequila, lime, and Coca-Cola, stirred with a knife.

**Recipe:**
- 2 oz blanco tequila
- 3/4 oz fresh lime juice
- 4 oz Coca-Cola
- Salt for rim
- Lime wedge for garnish

Salt rim of highball glass. Add ice, tequila, and lime juice. Top with Coca-Cola. Stir gently—traditionally with a knife.

Don Javier Delgado Corona served his signature drink at La Capilla in Tequila, Jalisco for nearly 60 years. The name came from a rotund regular customer ("batanga" roughly translates to "chubby" in local slang). The preparation became ritual: Don Javier stirred every Batanga with the same knife he used to cut limes. He continued this practice into his nineties, until his death in 2020 at age 96. The Batanga exploded on TikTok in 2024-2025, proving that great cocktails don't require complexity.

### Tommy's Margarita

A streamlined Margarita using agave nectar instead of orange liqueur—letting the tequila shine.

**Recipe:**
- 1.5 oz reposado tequila (or blanco)
- 3/4 oz fresh lime juice
- 1/2 oz agave syrup
- 3 drops saline solution (optional but recommended)

Shake with ice. Double strain into chilled coupe.

Julio Bermejo created this in the early 1990s at his family's Tommy's Mexican Restaurant in San Francisco. His philosophy—"respecting the agave"—drove the change. Triple sec masks agave flavor; agave nectar complements it. The Tommy's Margarita became the first venue-specific cocktail recognized by the International Bartenders Association (2008).

## Intermediate

### El Diablo

A devilishly refreshing highball—tequila meets crème de cassis, lime, and ginger beer.

**Recipe:**
- 2 oz reposado tequila
- 3/4 oz fresh lime juice
- 1/2 oz crème de cassis
- 1/4 oz simple syrup
- 3 dashes Angostura bitters
- Ginger beer to top
- Mint sprig for garnish

Shake all ingredients except ginger beer with ice. Strain into highball glass over fresh ice. Top with ginger beer.

The El Diablo appeared in Trader Vic's 1946 *Book of Food and Drink* as the "Mexican El Diablo"—one of the earliest tequila cocktails in American print. The reddish color from cassis might suggest something infernal, but the flavor is balanced and refreshing. Cassis adds berry sweetness; ginger adds spice; lime ties everything together.

---

### Siesta

A tequila twist on the Hemingway Daiquiri, using Campari instead of maraschino.

**Recipe:**
- 1.5 oz blanco tequila
- 1/2 oz fresh lime juice
- 1/2 oz fresh grapefruit juice
- 1/2 oz Campari
- 1/2 oz simple syrup
- 2 dashes Angostura bitters
- Orange peel for garnish

Shake with ice. Double strain into chilled coupe. Express orange peel over surface.

Katie Stipe created the Siesta in 2006 at New York's Flatiron Lounge. Campari's bitterness balances grapefruit's natural tartness while blanco tequila's vegetal character adds complexity. The drink's recognition grew through bartender networks and its appearance in the Speed Rack competition.

---

### Mexican Firing Squad Special

A pre-Prohibition era tequila sour with grenadine and bitters—more complex than the later Tequila Sunrise.

**Recipe:**
- 2 oz blanco tequila
- 3/4 oz fresh lime juice
- 3/4 oz grenadine
- 2 dashes Angostura bitters
- Soda water to top
- Orange peel for garnish

Shake tequila, lime juice, grenadine, and bitters with ice. Strain into highball glass over fresh ice. Top with soda water.

Travel writer Charles H. Baker documented this cocktail in his 1939 *Gentleman's Companion*, claiming to have discovered it at La Cucaracha Cocktail Club in Mexico City in 1937. During Prohibition, Mexico City bars thrived on American expats seeking quality drinks. Angostura bitters transform what could be simple into something layered.

---

### Oaxaca Old Fashioned

Phil Ward's revolutionary split-base Old Fashioned—tequila and mezcal together with agave syrup.

**Recipe:**
- 1.5 oz reposado tequila
- 0.5 oz mezcal
- 1 barspoon agave syrup
- 2 dashes Angostura bitters
- Orange peel for garnish

Stir all ingredients with ice. Strain into rocks glass over large ice cube. Express orange peel over surface and drop in.

Created at Death & Co. in New York around 2007, this drink helped launch mezcal into modern cocktail consciousness. Using mezcal alone would overwhelm; using tequila alone lacks distinctiveness. Together, they create something with mezcal's signature smoke tempered by tequila's cleaner agave character. Ward's subsequent opening of Mayahuel proved that agave spirits could support an entire cocktail program.

---

### Division Bell

Equal-parts mezcal cocktail applying Last Word logic—mezcal, Aperol, maraschino, and lime.

**Recipe:**
- 1 oz mezcal
- 3/4 oz Aperol
- 1/2 oz maraschino liqueur
- 3/4 oz fresh lime juice
- Grapefruit twist for garnish

Shake with ice. Double strain into chilled coupe.

Phil Ward created this at Mayahuel in 2009, naming it after Pink Floyd's 1994 album—which he played repeatedly while constructing the bar. The Division Bell was significant in demonstrating mezcal's cocktail versatility. Aperol's bittersweet orange character complements mezcal's smoke without competing.

---

### Naked and Famous

Equal parts mezcal, Aperol, yellow Chartreuse, and lime—bold, balanced, and unapologetic.

**Recipe:**
- 3/4 oz mezcal
- 3/4 oz Aperol
- 3/4 oz yellow Chartreuse
- 3/4 oz fresh lime juice

Shake with ice. Double strain into chilled coupe.

Joaquín Simó created this at Death & Co. in 2011, describing it as "the bastard child born out of an illicit Oaxacan love affair between the classic Last Word and the Paper Plane." The name comes from the 1996 Tricky song "Tricky Kid." Yellow Chartreuse—less intense than its green sibling—proves essential; green would overwhelm the smoke.

---

### Tequila Matador

A tropical Margarita variation—tequila with pineapple and lime, blended frozen.

**Recipe:**
- 2 oz blanco tequila
- 2 oz pineapple juice
- 3/4 oz fresh lime juice

Blend with crushed ice. Pour into highball glass.

Two distinct recipes share this name. The earlier version appeared in the 1937 *Café Royal Cocktail Book*—tequila, dry vermouth, and orange curaçao in an apéritif style. This tropical version was published in Trader Vic's 1972 *Bartender's Guide*, offering a simple Margarita variation with pineapple juice replacing other ingredients. The combination of popular Mexican exports—tequila, pineapple, and lime—suggests possible Mexican origins.

## Advanced

### Spicy Jalapeño Margarita

Fresh chile heat meets classic Margarita—the drink that made spicy cocktails mainstream.

**Recipe:**
- 2 oz blanco tequila
- 1 oz orange liqueur
- 1 oz fresh lime juice
- 1/2 oz agave syrup
- 2-3 jalapeño slices
- Tajín for rim
- Jalapeño slice and lime wheel for garnish

Muddle jalapeño in shaker. Add remaining ingredients and ice. Shake vigorously. Strain into Tajín-rimmed rocks glass over fresh ice.

Fresh chile heat in cocktails became mainstream in the 2020s, with the jalapeño Margarita leading the trend. Two methods dominate: muddling fresh jalapeño directly in the shaker or using jalapeño-infused tequila. Tajín—the Mexican chile-lime-salt seasoning—has largely replaced plain salt on spicy Margarita rims, adding another dimension of heat and complexity.

### Part-Time Lover

A sophisticated tequila sour with Aperol and elderflower—Los Angeles cocktail culture at its finest.

**Recipe:**
- 1.5 oz blanco tequila
- 1/2 oz Aperol
- 1/2 oz elderflower liqueur
- 3/4 oz fresh lemon juice
- 2 dashes Angostura bitters
- Grapefruit twist for garnish

Shake with ice. Strain over fresh ice in rocks glass. Express grapefruit peel over surface.

Jon Weimorts created this at Idle Hour in Los Angeles, demonstrating that blanco tequila can anchor aperitif-style drinks as effectively as gin or vodka. The name—referencing Stevie Wonder's 1985 hit—suggests the drink's casual versatility: appropriate for many occasions rather than one specific moment.

---

### Nice & Toasty

A spirit-forward stirred tequila drink with Cocchi Americano and Bénédictine—proof that tequila belongs in whiskey territory.

**Recipe:**
- 1.5 oz blanco tequila
- 1 oz Cocchi Americano
- 1/2 oz Bénédictine
- 8 dashes grapefruit bitters
- Flamed grapefruit twist for garnish

Stir all ingredients with ice until well-chilled. Strain into chilled coupe. Flame grapefruit twist over drink.

This winter-appropriate cocktail from @holycityhandcraft, featured by The Educated Barfly, proves tequila can work in spirit-forward, stirred drinks typically reserved for whiskey or gin. The flamed grapefruit garnish—heating the peel to caramelize oils before expressing them—adds theatrical presentation and genuine flavor complexity.

## Beyond These 15: Continuing Your Agave Journey

The drinks in this chapter demonstrate agave spirits' remarkable range—from refreshing highballs to spirit-forward stirred cocktails, from classic Mexican serves to modern American innovations.

**Margarita Variations:** The template (tequila + citrus + orange liqueur) invites endless modification. Substitute grapefruit for lime. Add fresh fruit—strawberry, mango, watermelon. Split the base with mezcal. The framework accommodates creativity while maintaining balance.

**Mezcal Exploration:** Beyond the cocktails here, mezcal works in many gin applications. A Mezcal Negroni (equal parts mezcal, Campari, sweet vermouth) adds smoke to the classic. The Mezcal Mule brings smoke to ginger beer. Experiment with smoke intensity—some mezcals overwhelm, others integrate beautifully.

**Tequila in Spirit-Forward Drinks:** The Oaxaca Old Fashioned opened doors. Try tequila in Manhattan variations, in stirred drinks with amaros, in templates designed for whiskey. The agave character often complements bitter Italian ingredients.

**Modern Innovation:** Bartenders continue pushing boundaries. Sous-vide infusions, fat-washing, clarified citrus—these techniques find new applications with agave spirits. The category remains fertile ground for experimentation.

**Sustainability Considerations:** Agave takes years to mature; current demand strains supply. Supporting producers committed to sustainable practices matters for the category's future. Some mezcal certifications (like the CRM) ensure traditional methods and fair compensation for producers.

The agave revolution shows no signs of slowing. What was once dismissed as harsh party fuel has become one of the cocktail world's most exciting spirits. These fifteen drinks provide vocabulary; the conversations you'll have with tequila and mezcal extend far beyond what any book can capture.
