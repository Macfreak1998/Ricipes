# Chapter 17: The Flip and Nog Family

Whole eggs in cocktails. Rich, creamy, custard-like drinks that bridge the gap between cocktail and dessert. The Flip and Nog families represent indulgence in liquid form.

## The Template

**The Flip Formula:**
- 2 oz spirit
- 1/2 oz sweetener
- 1 whole egg
- Nutmeg for garnish

Shake vigorously. Strain into small glass. Grate nutmeg.

**The Nog Formula:**
- Similar to Flip but with dairy added
- Traditionally served warm or cold

### Why Whole Eggs

Unlike egg white drinks (which add foam and texture), whole-egg drinks add:

**Richness:** Yolks contain fat that creates creamy mouthfeel.

**Body:** The combination of proteins and fats produces custard-like texture.

**Color:** Yolks add golden hue.

**Calories:** These are substantial drinks. One Flip is a commitment.

## The Master Recipe: Brandy Flip

**Brandy Flip:**
- 2 oz cognac
- 1/2 oz simple syrup
- 1 whole egg
- Freshly grated nutmeg for garnish

Add cognac, syrup, and egg to shaker. Dry shake vigorously (15+ seconds) to emulsify egg. Add ice, shake again until well chilled (15 seconds). Strain into small coupe or flip glass. Grate nutmeg over surface.

### Technique Notes

**Dry shake first:** The egg needs emulsification before chilling. Dry shaking without ice allows maximum agitation for combining yolk, white, and spirits.

**Shake hard:** Eggs require more agitation than most ingredients. Don't be gentle.

**Small glass:** Flips are rich. Serve in 4-5 oz portions, not full coupes.

**Fresh nutmeg:** Pre-ground nutmeg is flat and dusty. Fresh-grated nutmeg provides aromatic oils that define the drink.

## The Variations

### Coffee Cocktail

- 1.5 oz ruby port
- 1 oz cognac
- 1/2 oz simple syrup
- 1 whole egg
- Freshly grated nutmeg for garnish

Dry shake, wet shake, strain. Grate nutmeg.

**The name:** Allegedly named because its color resembles coffee. One of the great misnomers.

### Eggnog

The holiday classic.

**Single Serving:**
- 1.5 oz bourbon or rum (or both)
- 1 oz heavy cream
- 1/2 oz simple syrup

Dry shake, wet shake, strain into Collins glass over ice (or serve without ice, cold). Grate nutmeg.

**Batch Version (serves 8):**
- 6 eggs
- 3/4 cup sugar
- 2 cups heavy cream
- 2 cups whole milk
- 2 cups bourbon and/or rum
- Nutmeg for garnish

Separate eggs. Beat yolks with sugar until pale. Add spirits, then milk and cream. Beat whites to soft peaks. Fold whites into mixture. Chill. Serve with nutmeg.

**The tradition:** Eggnog originated in medieval Britain, crossed to colonial America, and became a holiday tradition. Washington, Jefferson, and many founders had their own recipes.

## The Science

### Egg Emulsification

Whole eggs combine properties of whites and yolks:

**Whites** contain proteins (albumin) that trap air when agitated, creating foam.

**Yolks** contain lecithin, a natural emulsifier that binds fat and water. This is why mayonnaise works—yolk emulsifies oil.

In cocktails, yolk creates stable integration between spirit, sweetener, and any dairy. The drink becomes unified rather than layered.

### Shaking Mechanics

Egg drinks require longer, harder shaking because:
- Proteins need mechanical action to denature and foam
- Fat (yolk) resists incorporation
- Without ice initially, there's no dilution to help

The dry shake allows agitation without thermal interference. Adding ice after emulsification locks in the texture while chilling.

### Safety Considerations

Raw eggs carry small salmonella risk. Mitigation:
- Use fresh eggs from reputable sources
- Store eggs properly (refrigerated)
- Pasteurized eggs eliminate risk entirely
- Alcohol provides some antimicrobial effect

In practice, millions of flips and nogs are consumed without incident. But know your risk tolerance.

## Common Mistakes and Fixes

### Eggy/Raw Taste

**Cause:** Under-shaking, poor emulsification.

**Fix:** Shake longer and harder. The egg flavor should integrate, not stand out.

### Chunky Texture

**Cause:** Insufficient emulsification, or straining failure.

**Fix:** Better dry shake. Double strain if needed.

### Flat (No Body)

**Cause:** Under-shaking or stale egg.

**Fix:** Fresher eggs, more vigorous shake.

### Too Rich

**Cause:** It's a Flip. They're rich.

**Fix:** Smaller portion, or choose a different drink family.

## Glassware and Service

### Glass Size

Flips are served in small glasses—4-5 oz coupes or dedicated flip glasses. These are concentrated drinks, not full-sized cocktails.

### Temperature

Most flips are served cold, but:
- Tom and Jerry is served warm
- Eggnog can go either way
- Historical flips were sometimes heated with a hot poker

### The Nutmeg

Always fresh-grated. The aromatic oils release as you grate, sitting on the foam surface and providing aroma with each sip. Pre-ground nutmeg lacks this impact entirely.

Keep a whole nutmeg and a microplane near your bar station if you make these drinks.

## The Flip's Place

Flips occupy a specific niche: rich, warming (even when cold), indulgent, occasional. They're not everyday drinks. They suit:

- Cold winter nights
- After-dinner indulgence
- Holiday celebrations
- Moments when excess is appropriate

Embrace this positioning. A well-made Flip at the right moment creates genuine delight.
