# Chapter 20: Modern Classics

Classics get made, not born. The drinks in this chapter have earned their place alongside century-old templates—through innovation, repetition, and the simple test of staying power.

What makes a modern classic? It must introduce something new (technique, combination, philosophy) while remaining accessible enough for widespread adoption. It must be replicable—if only one bartender can make it, it's a signature, not a classic. And it must persist beyond its initial trend cycle.

## The Modern Classic Criteria

**Defined template:** The drink establishes (or perfects) a replicable formula.

**Widespread adoption:** Made by bartenders globally, not just at one bar.

**Time-tested:** Survived at least 15-20 years of scrutiny.

**Influential:** Spawned variations and inspired further innovation.

The drinks here meet all four criteria.

## The Paper Plane Family

Sam Ross created the Paper Plane at Milk & Honey in 2007. Its genius: equal parts of four ingredients in perfect balance.

### Paper Plane

- 3/4 oz bourbon
- 3/4 oz Aperol
- 3/4 oz Amaro Nonino
- 3/4 oz fresh lemon juice

Shake with ice. Strain into chilled coupe.

**Why it works:** The equal-parts format (inherited from the Last Word) balances bourbon's warmth, Aperol's bitterness, Nonino's herbal complexity, and lemon's brightness.

**The template:** Spirit + bitter aperitivo + amaro + citrus. This template has generated dozens of variations.

### Naked and Famous

Phil Ward's mezcal version.

- 3/4 oz mezcal
- 3/4 oz Aperol
- 3/4 oz yellow Chartreuse
- 3/4 oz fresh lime juice

Shake. Strain into coupe.

**Character:** Smoky, bitter, herbal. The mezcal smoke plays against Chartreuse's herbs.

### Division Bell

Another Phil Ward creation.

- 1 oz mezcal
- 3/4 oz Aperol
- 1/2 oz maraschino liqueur
- 3/4 oz fresh lime juice

Shake. Strain into coupe.

**Character:** Less intense than Naked and Famous, more approachable.

## The Penicillin

Sam Ross again, this time at Milk & Honey around 2005. A modern whiskey sour with honey-ginger and smoky float.

### Penicillin

- 2 oz blended Scotch
- 3/4 oz fresh lemon juice
- 3/4 oz honey-ginger syrup
- 1/4 oz Islay single malt (float)
- Candied ginger for garnish

Shake Scotch, lemon, and honey-ginger syrup. Strain into rocks glass over ice. Float Islay on top. Garnish.

**The syrup:** Equal parts honey and fresh ginger juice (or simmer chopped ginger in honey-water mixture).

**The float:** The smoky Islay malt sits on top, providing aromatic smoke with each sip before integrating.

**Why it works:** The template (whiskey sour + ginger + smoke) is intuitive once demonstrated, not obvious beforehand.

### Variations

**Gold Rush:** The simplified ancestor—bourbon, lemon, honey syrup. Made by T.J. Siegal at Milk & Honey.

**Industry Sour:** Fernet replaces the Islay float for more herbal intensity.

## The Espresso Martini

Dick Bradsell created this around 1983 at London's Soho Brasserie. It took decades to become a phenomenon, but it's now the most-ordered cocktail in many markets.

### Espresso Martini

- 1.5 oz vodka
- 3/4 oz coffee liqueur
- 1/4 oz simple syrup
- 1 oz fresh espresso
- Three espresso beans for garnish

Shake all ingredients vigorously until well-chilled and frothy. Strain into chilled coupe.

**The foam:** Proper shaking creates the signature foam cap. Fresh espresso (with crema) helps; stale coffee fails.

**The timing:** The original name was "Vodka Espresso," then "Pharmaceutical Stimulant." "Espresso Martini" emerged in the 1990s V-glass naming trend.

### Variations

**Breakfast Italiano:** Limoncello replaces coffee liqueur.

**The Nookie:** Frangelico joins the coffee-vodka base.

**Parmesan Espresso Martini:** Parmesan cheese grated on top (the umami enhances coffee).

## The Aperol Spritz

Not invented recently, but popularized globally in the 2000s-2010s. The Italian aperitivo tradition went worldwide.

### Aperol Spritz

- 3 oz prosecco
- 2 oz Aperol
- 1 oz soda water
- Orange slice for garnish

Build in wine glass over ice. Add prosecco, then Aperol, then soda. Stir gently.

**Why it conquered:** Low ABV, approachable bitterness, Instagram-friendly color, accessible ingredients.

**The template:** Bitter liqueur + sparkling wine + soda. Works with Campari, Select, Cynar, others.

## The Bramble

Dick Bradsell's second appearance in this chapter—the gin-berry classic from 1984.

### Bramble

- 2 oz gin
- 1 oz fresh lemon juice
- 1/2 oz simple syrup
- 1/2 oz créme de mure (drizzled)
- Blackberries and lemon wheel for garnish

Shake gin, lemon, and syrup. Strain into rocks glass over crushed ice. Drizzle créme de mure over top (don't mix). Garnish.

**The visual:** The créme de mure sinks through crushed ice, creating purple tendrils.

## The Last Word Revival

The Last Word was created in 1916 but forgotten until Murray Stenson revived it at Zig Zag Café in Seattle around 2004.

### Last Word

- 3/4 oz gin
- 3/4 oz green Chartreuse
- 3/4 oz maraschino liqueur
- 3/4 oz fresh lime juice

Shake. Strain into coupe.

**Why it waited:** Chartreuse was harder to find mid-century. The craft cocktail revival brought it back.

**The template:** Equal-parts sours with two liqueurs became a format after this revival.

---

## The Tommy's Margarita

Julio Bermejo simplified the Margarita at Tommy's Mexican Restaurant in San Francisco. The result—agave syrup replacing orange liqueur—has become as standard as the original.

### Tommy's Margarita

- 2 oz blanco tequila
- 1 oz fresh lime juice
- 1/2 oz agave syrup

Shake. Strain into rocks glass over ice.

**Why it works:** Removing Cointreau lets tequila shine. Agave syrup echoes tequila's source plant. Simpler and arguably better balanced.

---

## The Oaxaca Old Fashioned

Phil Ward at Death & Co, 2007. The mezcal Old Fashioned that introduced many to agave cocktails.

### Oaxaca Old Fashioned

- 1.5 oz reposado tequila
- 0.5 oz mezcal
- 1 barspoon agave syrup
- 2 dashes Angostura bitters
- Orange twist for garnish

Build in rocks glass over large ice cube. Stir. Express and flame orange twist.

**The split base:** Tequila provides structure; mezcal adds smoke. The combination is more interesting than either alone.

---

## The Corpse Reviver #2 Revival

Like the Last Word, this 1930s drink waited for rediscovery.

### Corpse Reviver #2

- 3/4 oz gin
- 3/4 oz Cointreau
- 3/4 oz Lillet Blanc
- 3/4 oz fresh lemon juice
- 1 dash absinthe
- Lemon twist for garnish

Shake. Strain into coupe.

**The warning:** Harry Craddock noted that "Four of these taken in swift succession will un-revive the corpse again."

## Common Threads

What unites these modern classics?

**Balance innovation:** Paper Plane, Penicillin, and Tommy's Margarita all reconsidered balance in their respective templates.

**Ingredient introduction:** Many introduced ingredients to broader awareness (Aperol, Amaro Nonino, mezcal).

**Simplicity:** Most use four or fewer ingredients. Complexity comes from combination, not quantity.

**Replicability:** Clear recipes, available ingredients, teachable techniques.

## Creating Future Classics

The modern classic template suggests paths forward:

**Take a classic template, change one variable:** Paper Plane is a Last Word variation. Naked and Famous is a Paper Plane variation. The chain continues.

**Introduce an ingredient:** If you find an unusual ingredient that balances beautifully, build around it.

**Simplify:** Tommy's Margarita succeeded by removing an ingredient. What else could be simplified?

**Combine traditions:** Oaxaca Old Fashioned marries Mexican spirits with American template. What other cultural combinations await?

The next modern classic is being invented now, probably at a bar you haven't visited yet. Someone is discovering a combination that will seem obvious in retrospect.

That's how classics work.
