# Chapter 6: Advanced Techniques

The fundamentals—shaking, stirring, building, straining—cover 95% of cocktail making. But the remaining 5% contains some of the most impressive and rewarding techniques. This chapter introduces advanced methods that expand what's possible.

These aren't party tricks. Each technique solves a specific problem or achieves a specific effect. Understanding why they exist matters as much as learning how to execute them.

## Flaming Citrus Peels

When you express citrus peel, oils mist across the drink's surface. When you express citrus peel through a flame, those oils ignite briefly, caramelizing and adding smoke notes that regular expression doesn't provide.

### The Technique

1. Prepare a coin-sized piece of citrus peel (orange is traditional)
2. Light a match or lighter
3. Hold the peel over the drink, skin-side facing the flame
4. Squeeze/twist the peel toward the flame
5. The oils will ignite in a brief burst of flame
6. The caramelized oils land on the drink

### Why It Works

Citrus oils (primarily limonene) are flammable. The flame ignites them briefly, producing:
- Visual drama (always crowd-pleasing)
- Smoke compounds that add depth
- Caramelization of sugars in the oils
- A slightly bitter, toasted note

### Best Applications

- Old Fashioned (orange peel)
- Sazerac (lemon peel)
- Any spirit-forward, amber-colored drink

Not appropriate for light, fresh drinks where smoke would clash.

### Tips

- Fresh peel flames better than old
- Orange flames most reliably; lemon and grapefruit work but less dramatically
- The burst is brief—don't expect sustained fire
- Practice away from guests until comfortable

## Fat Washing

Fat washing infuses spirits with fat-based flavors (butter, bacon, olive oil, etc.) while removing the fat itself, leaving clear liquid with acquired flavor.

### The Theory

Fats dissolve fat-soluble flavor compounds. Alcohol also dissolves many flavors. When fat meets spirit, flavors exchange. When you freeze the mixture, the fat solidifies and can be removed, leaving behind the flavors it carried.

### The Basic Process

1. **Warm the fat** until liquid (bacon fat, butter, coconut oil, etc.)
2. **Combine with spirit** at roughly 1-2 oz fat per 750ml spirit
3. **Let sit at room temperature** for several hours, agitating occasionally
4. **Freeze** until fat solidifies (overnight is safe)
5. **Remove solid fat** from surface
6. **Fine strain** through cheesecloth/coffee filter to remove particles

### Common Applications

**Bacon-washed bourbon:** Savory, smoky depth for Old Fashioneds

**Brown butter-washed rum:** Nutty, rich character

**Olive oil-washed gin:** Herbaceous, Mediterranean character

**Sesame oil-washed whiskey:** Asian-inspired cocktails

### Considerations

- Use rendered fat, not raw (renders remove water that causes cloudiness)
- More fat = more flavor transfer, but diminishing returns
- Some flavor compounds transfer better than others
- The spirit will feel slightly different on the palate (rounder, more viscous)
- Fat-washed spirits keep well but should be refrigerated

## Clarification

Clarification removes all particles from cocktails, producing crystal-clear liquids from ingredients that would normally create cloudy drinks. A clarified Piña Colada is transparent. A clarified Bloody Mary looks like water.

### Why Clarify?

- Aesthetic novelty (surprising presentations)
- Texture change (clearer drinks feel "cleaner")
- Stability (clarified drinks keep longer)
- Pre-batching (makes complex drinks suitable for bottling)

### Milk Clarification

The classic method. Milk proteins (casein) bind to particulates and precipitate out when they meet acid, carrying clarity-disrupting compounds with them.

**Process:**
1. Make your cocktail (with citrus or other acid)
2. Add whole milk at roughly 25-30% of cocktail volume
3. The milk will curdle immediately—this is correct
4. Let sit for several hours (refrigerated)
5. Strain through cheesecloth or coffee filter
6. The liquid passes through; curds remain behind

**Results:** Crystal-clear liquid that tastes remarkably like the original cocktail, minus certain astringent/tannic notes the curds captured.

### Agar Clarification

Uses agar (a seaweed-derived gelling agent) to capture particles.

**Process:**
1. Dissolve agar in your cocktail (0.2-0.5% by weight)
2. Chill until set
3. Freeze the gel solid
4. Thaw in a strainer lined with cheesecloth
5. Clear liquid drips through; particles remain in gel structure

### Considerations

- Clarification changes flavor (removes some compounds)
- The process takes hours/overnight
- Works best with batched cocktails
- Some drinks clarify better than others

## Carbonation

Adding CO2 to cocktails produces sparkle and texture where none naturally exists. A carbonated Negroni. A fizzy Margarita. Possibilities that pre-mixed drinks can't achieve.

### Methods

**iSi Whip (cream charger):**
1. Add cocktail to iSi canister
2. Charge with CO2 cartridge
3. Shake to incorporate
4. Chill thoroughly
5. Dispense carefully

**SodaStream (or similar):**
1. Chill cocktail thoroughly (cold absorbs more CO2)
2. Carbonate in machine
3. Dispense gently

**Force carbonation (kegs):**
1. Add cocktail to keg
2. Apply CO2 pressure
3. Let sit under pressure for 24+ hours
4. Serve from tap

### Considerations

- Colder = more carbonation retained
- Alcohol fights carbonation (spirits don't hold bubbles well)
- Sugar helps retain carbonation
- Dilution is already incorporated (no further mixing/shaking)
- Must be poured gently or carbonation escapes

### Best Applications

- Pre-batched cocktails for events
- Low-ABV drinks (retain carbonation better)
- Experimental/novel presentations

## Smoking

Adding smoke to cocktails creates aroma and flavor complexity through wood smoke compounds.

### Methods

**Smoking gun:**
A handheld device that smolders wood chips and directs smoke through a tube. Smoke the glass or capture smoke under a cloche.

**Smoked ice:**
Expose ice to smoke before using. As ice melts, it releases smoke compounds.

**Smoked ingredients:**
Smoke individual ingredients (citrus, spirits, syrups) before mixing.

**Burning wood:**
Ignite wood chips directly, capturing smoke in the glass or under cover.

### Common Applications

- Smoked Old Fashioned (dramatic presentation)
- Mezcal cocktails (enhancing existing smoke)
- Whiskey drinks (complementary flavor)

### Considerations

- A little smoke goes a long way—easy to overdo
- Smoke dissipates quickly; serve immediately after smoking
- Different woods produce different smoke profiles (applewood vs. hickory vs. mesquite)
- Some guests dislike smoke; ask first

## Infusing

Beyond fat-washing, spirits can be infused with countless flavors.

### Quick Infusions

**Tea infusion:** Steep tea in spirit for 5-30 minutes. Earl Grey gin, chamomile vodka, etc.

**Herb infusion:** Steep fresh herbs for hours/days. Rosemary-infused gin, basil vodka, etc.

**Spice infusion:** Steep spices for hours/days. Cinnamon whiskey, vanilla rum, etc.

### Long Infusions

**Fruit infusion:** Days to weeks. Cherry bourbon, citrus vodka, etc.

**Vegetable infusion:** Days. Pepper-infused tequila, cucumber gin, etc.

### Process

1. Add flavoring agent to spirit in clean container
2. Store at room temperature (or refrigerate for delicate ingredients)
3. Taste periodically
4. Strain when flavor is right
5. Fine strain to remove particles

### Considerations

- Taste frequently—infusion time varies by ingredient
- Some flavors extract quickly (tea); others take days (vanilla)
- Color changes are common and usually desirable
- Label and date everything
- Refrigerate finished infusions if containing perishable ingredients

## Sous Vide Techniques

Immersion circulators allow precise temperature control for:

**Rapid infusion:** Heat accelerates extraction. A 2-hour sous vide infusion can match a week-long room-temperature steep.

**Fat washing:** Controlled temperature optimizes fat-flavor exchange.

**Syrup making:** Precise temperatures produce consistent syrups.

### Basic Sous Vide Infusion

1. Combine spirit and flavoring in vacuum bag (or zipper bag with air removed)
2. Set immersion circulator to 135-155°F (57-68°C)
3. Immerse bagged spirit for 1-3 hours
4. Cool, strain, use

### Considerations

- Temperature affects which compounds extract
- Some flavors develop off-notes when heated
- Not all ingredients suit sous vide (delicate herbs can turn bitter)
- Produces very consistent results once dialed in

## Nitrogen and Special Effects

For theatrical presentations:

**Liquid nitrogen:** Flash-freezes glassware, creates fog, makes instant frozen drinks. Requires safety training and proper handling.

**Dry ice:** Creates dramatic fog. Don't serve pieces in drinks (burns); use for atmosphere only.

**Aromatic bubbles:** Created with specialized equipment, adding floating aromatic bubbles over drinks.

### Considerations

- Effects require equipment investment
- Safety concerns are real
- Novelty can overwhelm the drink itself
- Best reserved for special occasions/themes

## When to Use Advanced Techniques

The question isn't whether you can use these techniques—it's whether you should.

**Use advanced techniques when:**
- The technique genuinely improves the drink
- The audience will appreciate the craft
- You have time to execute properly
- The technique serves the concept

**Skip advanced techniques when:**
- Showing off for its own sake
- The technique obscures the drink's essence
- Time pressure compromises execution
- Simpler methods achieve the same result

The best bartenders know when to deploy advanced methods and when to make a perfect Daiquiri. Often the Daiquiri is the right answer.
