# Chapter 8: Taste and Adjustment

Every technique in this book exists to produce drinks worth tasting. But tasting itself is a technique—one that many bartenders never formally learn. This chapter teaches you to taste systematically, diagnose problems, and adjust drinks to perfection.

## How to Taste Properly

Tasting cocktails differs from drinking them. When drinking, you're enjoying. When tasting, you're analyzing.

### The Tasting Protocol

**1. Smell first.**
Before liquid touches your lips, bring the glass to your nose. Inhale gently. Aroma provides preview information—sweetness, citrus brightness, spirit character, aromatic complexity.

**2. Take a small sip.**
Not a full drink—a small amount that you can move around your mouth.

**3. Let it coat your tongue.**
Move the liquid across all areas of your tongue. Different tastes register in different regions (though the "taste map" is oversimplified, regional sensitivity does exist).

**4. Note the attack.**
What hits first? Sweetness usually registers earliest, followed by sourness, then bitterness on the finish. What's the dominant initial impression?

**5. Note the body.**
How does the liquid feel? Thin or viscous? Smooth or sharp? Warming or cooling?

**6. Note the finish.**
After swallowing (or spitting, for extended tasting sessions), what remains? Does the flavor linger pleasantly or disappear? Is there bitterness emerging? Heat?

**7. Assess overall balance.**
After the analytical pass, take a mental step back. Is the drink harmonious? Does anything stick out?

### Environmental Factors

**Palate fatigue:** After tasting several drinks, your palate becomes less sensitive. Space tastings. Eat neutral foods (bread, crackers) between drinks. Rinse with water.

**Temperature:** Cold suppresses certain flavors. Taste drinks at serving temperature, but also taste at room temperature to reveal character.

**Expectation:** Knowing what a drink "should" taste like affects perception. Try blind tasting to remove bias.

**Time of day:** Palates are sharpest mid-morning, after light eating. Late-night tasting after heavy food and drink is unreliable.

## Identifying Imbalance

When a drink doesn't work, something is out of balance. Learning to identify what makes diagnosis possible.

### Too Sweet

**Symptoms:**
- Cloying, syrupy quality
- Flavors muddled together
- Finish feels heavy
- You want something to cut through

**Likely causes:**
- Too much sweetener
- Not enough acid
- Over-ripe or sweet citrus
- Sweet liqueur added to already-sweet recipe

**Adjustments:**
- Add acid (citrus juice, even a few drops)
- Dilute slightly (more ice, longer stir)
- Add bitter element (bitters, bitter liqueur)
- Remake with reduced sweetener

### Too Sour

**Symptoms:**
- Mouth-puckering acidity
- Harsh, sharp attack
- Other flavors obscured
- Unpleasant finish

**Likely causes:**
- Too much citrus
- Not enough sweetener
- Very acidic citrus (early season limes)
- Under-dilution (acid more prominent without water integration)

**Adjustments:**
- Add sweetener (bar spoon of syrup)
- Dilute more (acid becomes less prominent with dilution)
- Add spirit (shifts ratio)
- Remake with reduced citrus

### Too Bitter

**Symptoms:**
- Aggressive bitter finish
- Other flavors overwhelmed
- Astringent mouthfeel
- Unpleasant for those who don't love bitter

**Likely causes:**
- Too much bitter ingredient (Campari, amaro)
- Over-muddled herbs (chlorophyll extraction)
- Citrus pith in drink
- Bitters over-poured

**Adjustments:**
- Add sweetness (counters bitterness perception)
- Serve colder (cold suppresses bitterness)
- Dilute (bitterness becomes less concentrated)
- Remake with adjusted bitter components

### Too Strong (Alcoholic Heat)

**Symptoms:**
- Burning sensation on tongue and throat
- Alcohol smell dominates
- Other flavors hard to perceive
- Warming to the point of discomfort

**Likely causes:**
- Under-dilution
- Overproof spirit in standard recipe
- Too much spirit relative to modifiers
- Inadequate chilling

**Adjustments:**
- Dilute more (stir/shake longer, or add water)
- Serve colder
- Add more modifier (citrus, sweetener)
- Remake with adjusted ratios or different spirit

### Too Weak

**Symptoms:**
- Watery, thin mouthfeel
- Spirit character lost
- Flavors washed out
- Unsatisfying finish

**Likely causes:**
- Over-dilution
- Too little spirit
- Weak ice (pre-melted, too warm)
- Over-stirring/shaking

**Adjustments:**
- Add spirit (carefully—a little goes a long way)
- Less dilution next time
- Use colder/harder ice
- Serve in smaller glass (less perceived thinness)

### Unintegrated

**Symptoms:**
- Flavors don't cohere
- Ingredients taste separate
- Layered rather than blended
- Something "off" that's hard to pinpoint

**Likely causes:**
- Under-shaking/stirring
- Technique mismatch (stirred when should shake)
- Incompatible ingredients
- Temperature inconsistency

**Adjustments:**
- More integration (shake/stir longer)
- Consider technique change
- Ensure adequate dilution
- Remake with attention to integration

## Making Adjustments

### The Rule of Small Changes

Never make large adjustments. A quarter ounce changes a drink significantly. A bar spoon of syrup shifts sweetness noticeably.

**Process:**
1. Identify the problem
2. Add smallest reasonable adjustment
3. Stir to incorporate
4. Taste again
5. Repeat if needed

### Adjustment Toolkit

Keep these at hand when developing or fixing drinks:

**Simple syrup:** Adds sweetness without flavor
**Citrus juice:** Adds acidity (keep both lemon and lime)
**Saline solution:** (20% salt by weight) A few drops enhances flavor without adding detectable saltiness
**Bitters:** Adds complexity and bitter balance
**Water:** Dilutes everything proportionally

### Documentation

When adjusting drinks:
1. Note starting recipe
2. Note each adjustment
3. Note final result
4. Record whether it worked

This documentation becomes invaluable for recipe development and diagnosing recurring problems.

## Seasonal and Environmental Adjustments

### Temperature Effects

**Hot weather:** Drinks seem less sweet, more refreshing. Consider slightly increasing sweetness in summer.

**Cold weather:** Drinks seem sweeter, heavier. Consider slightly decreasing sweetness or increasing acid.

### Citrus Variation

Citrus acidity varies by season, variety, and individual fruit:
- Early-season limes: More acidic
- Late-season lemons: Sweeter
- Persian vs. Key limes: Different acid profiles
- Organic vs. conventional: Often different

**Adjustment:** Taste your citrus. If particularly sour, reduce quantity or increase sweet. If particularly sweet, increase quantity or reduce sweet.

### Ingredient Batches

Spirits, vermouths, and liqueurs vary between bottles. A new bottle of vermouth may be fresher (more aromatic, slightly different) than the end of the previous bottle.

**Adjustment:** When opening new bottles of key ingredients, taste and recalibrate recipes if needed.

## Training Your Palate

Palate sensitivity improves with practice. Here are exercises:

### Calibration Tastings

Make the same drink with deliberate variations:
1. Standard recipe
2. +0.25 oz sweet
3. -0.25 oz sweet
4. +0.25 oz citrus
5. -0.25 oz citrus

Taste blind. Identify which is which. Learn how small changes taste.

### Ingredient Isolation

Taste individual ingredients neat:
- Different gins side by side
- Different vermouths
- Different sweeteners (simple vs. rich vs. honey)

Learn their characteristics so you can identify them in cocktails.

### Competitive Tasting

With a partner:
1. One person makes a drink
2. Other tastes and identifies ingredients
3. Discuss perceptions
4. Switch roles

Different people perceive differently. Learning what others taste expands your awareness.

### Progressive Difficulty

Start with obvious problems (drink made with 2x citrus), progress to subtle ones (drink with 0.1 oz extra citrus). Train yourself to detect smaller and smaller variations.

## The Feedback Loop

Tasting isn't the end—it's part of a continuous loop:

1. **Make** the drink with proper technique
2. **Taste** systematically
3. **Diagnose** any problems
4. **Adjust** with small changes
5. **Taste** again
6. **Document** results
7. **Apply** learning to next drink

This loop operates constantly for professional bartenders. Every drink is data. Every tasting is calibration. Over time, your ability to predict outcomes improves, and your drinks get better.

## The Confidence Question

New bartenders often lack confidence in their tasting. "Is this right? Should it taste like this?"

**Building confidence:**
- Taste many versions of the same drink (yours and others')
- Compare to established benchmarks (great bars, trusted recipes)
- Accept that taste is somewhat subjective
- Trust systematic analysis over gut feeling

There's no single "correct" taste for most cocktails. But there is a range of acceptable outcomes, and there are definitely wrong outcomes. Your job is to stay in the acceptable range and push toward the excellent end.

## When Good Enough Is Good Enough

Perfectionism has limits. At some point:
- The drink is balanced and enjoyable
- Further adjustment yields diminishing returns
- The guest is waiting
- Overthinking creates its own problems

Learn to recognize "good enough" and move on. Perfect is the enemy of good—and of getting drinks to guests at the right temperature.
