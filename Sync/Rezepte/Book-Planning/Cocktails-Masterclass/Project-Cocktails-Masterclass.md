## Book Concept

### Elevator Pitch
The comprehensive masterclass in classic cocktail technique—organized by cocktail family and technique. Learn the 7 foundational templates that generate hundreds of drinks, master the 10 essential techniques, and understand the science behind perfect execution. This isn't a recipe book—it's a bartending education.

### Core Themes
1. **Technique Over Recipes**: Understanding WHY enables infinite creativity
2. **Cocktail Families**: Every drink is a variation on a template
3. **The Science**: Chemistry and physics of proper execution
4. **Historical Context**: How classics evolved and why they work
5. **Professional Standards**: Execution that separates amateurs from pros

### What Makes This Book Different?
- Organized by cocktail FAMILY, not spirit (Sours, Martinis, Manhattans, etc.)
- Deep technique chapters BEFORE recipes
- The science explained simply
- Master one template, unlock dozens of drinks
- Professional bartender standards throughout
- Historical evolution of each family
- Common mistakes and how to fix them
