# Chapter 15: The Collins and Fizz Family

Take a sour. Add soda. You've entered the Collins/Fizz family—drinks that combine the citrus-sweetener-spirit formula with effervescence.

The distinction between Collins and Fizz is subtle: Collinses are typically served long over ice; Fizzes are typically served shorter, often without ice. But the families intertwine so thoroughly that they're best understood together.

## The Template

**The Collins/Fizz Formula:**
- 2 oz spirit
- 3/4 oz citrus juice
- 1/2-3/4 oz sweetener
- Soda water to top

Shake base ingredients. Strain into ice-filled glass. Top with soda.

### Why Add Soda

**Refreshment:** Carbonation adds textural brightness and physical refreshment.

**Lightness:** Extending with soda reduces ABV and makes the drink more sessionable.

**Temperature maintenance:** The soda (poured cold) helps maintain serving temperature.

**Volume:** A larger drink for occasions requiring sustained drinking.

## The Master Recipe: Tom Collins

**Tom Collins:**
- 2 oz London dry gin
- 1 oz fresh lemon juice
- 3/4 oz simple syrup
- Soda water to top
- Lemon wheel and cherry for garnish

Shake gin, lemon, and syrup with ice. Strain into ice-filled Collins glass. Top with soda. Stir gently once. Garnish.

### Technique Notes

**Shake the base:** The sour components need integration. Shake vigorously, then add soda.

**Don't shake the soda:** Shaking carbonated liquid destroys the bubbles.

**Gentle top:** Pour soda gently down the side.

**Minimal stir:** Integrate without destroying effervescence.

## Collins vs. Fizz

### The Collins

- Served in Collins glass (12-14 oz)
- Served over ice
- More soda, more volume
- Leisurely drinking pace

### The Fizz

- Served in smaller glass (8-10 oz)
- Often served without ice
- Less soda, more concentrated
- Quicker drinking pace

### The Practical Reality

These distinctions have blurred. Many modern bars serve both over ice, in similar glassware, with similar volumes. The names persist but the differences have diminished.

## The Variations

---

### Gin Fizz

The Fizz format of Tom Collins.

- 2 oz gin
- 1 oz fresh lemon juice
- 3/4 oz simple syrup
- Soda water to top

Shake base. Strain into fizz glass (without ice traditional, with ice modern). Top with soda.

### Ramos Gin Fizz

The legendary New Orleans creation—cream, egg white, and orange flower water.

- 2 oz gin
- 1/2 oz fresh lemon juice
- 1/2 oz fresh lime juice
- 1 oz simple syrup
- 1 oz heavy cream
- 1 egg white
- 3-4 drops orange flower water
- Soda water to top

Dry shake all ingredients except soda vigorously (30+ seconds). Add ice, shake again. Strain into Collins glass (no ice). Top with soda, pouring slowly to build the foam up.

**The challenge:** This drink requires extended shaking to properly emulsify cream and egg white. Henry Ramos allegedly kept a team of "shaker boys" working in rotation.

**The foam:** A properly made Ramos has foam rising above the glass rim. The soda poured into the center pushes the foam upward.

### Silver Fizz

Gin Fizz with egg white.

- 2 oz gin
- 1 oz fresh lemon juice
- 3/4 oz simple syrup
- 1 egg white
- Soda water to top

Dry shake, then wet shake. Strain into glass. Top with soda.

**Character:** Silky texture from egg white, frothy top.

---

### Golden Fizz

Gin Fizz with egg yolk.

- 2 oz gin
- 1 oz fresh lemon juice
- 3/4 oz simple syrup
- 1 egg yolk
- Soda water to top

Shake well (the yolk needs integration). Strain. Top with soda.

**Character:** Richer, more custard-like, golden color.

---

### Royal Fizz

Gin Fizz with whole egg.

- 2 oz gin
- 1 oz fresh lemon juice
- 3/4 oz simple syrup
- 1 whole egg
- Soda water to top

Shake very well. Strain. Top with soda.

**Character:** Combines silver and golden characteristics.

---

### French 75

The Champagne Collins—gin sour topped with Champagne.

- 1 oz gin
- 1/2 oz fresh lemon juice
- 1/2 oz simple syrup
- 3 oz Champagne (or sparkling wine)
- Lemon twist for garnish

Shake gin, lemon, and syrup. Strain into Champagne flute. Top with Champagne.

**The name:** Named for the French 75mm field gun—allegedly kicks like artillery.

**Variations:** Some versions use Cognac instead of gin. Both are legitimate.

---

### Whiskey Collins (John Collins)

Tom Collins with bourbon or whiskey.

- 2 oz bourbon
- 1 oz fresh lemon juice
- 3/4 oz simple syrup
- Soda water to top
- Orange slice and cherry for garnish

Shake base. Strain over ice. Top with soda.

**Historical note:** The John Collins (whiskey) may have preceded the Tom Collins (gin). Sources conflict.

---

### Vodka Collins

The predictable variation.

- 2 oz vodka
- 1 oz fresh lemon juice
- 3/4 oz simple syrup
- Soda water to top
- Lemon wheel for garnish

Shake base. Strain over ice. Top with soda.

---

### Aperol Fizz

Aperol joins the template.

- 1 oz gin
- 1 oz Aperol
- 3/4 oz fresh lemon juice
- 1/2 oz simple syrup
- Soda water to top
- Orange slice for garnish

Shake base. Strain over ice. Top with soda.

**Character:** Bitter-sweet, the Aperol adding complexity.

---

### Chicago Fizz

Rum and port with egg white.

- 1 oz white rum
- 1 oz ruby port
- 1/2 oz fresh lemon juice
- 1/2 oz simple syrup
- 1 egg white
- Soda water to top

Dry shake, wet shake. Strain (no ice). Top with soda.

**Character:** Rich, vinous, the port adding depth.

## The Science

### Egg White Foam

Proteins in egg white form stable foams when agitated. The dry shake (without ice) allows maximum agitation because:
- Cold inhibits foam formation
- Ice takes up space in the shaker
- Water from melting dilutes proteins

The subsequent wet shake chills without destroying the established foam.

### Cream Emulsion

In drinks like the Ramos, cream requires mechanical emulsification to integrate with citrus and spirits. Without sufficient shaking:
- Cream separates
- Texture is uneven
- The characteristic foam doesn't form

Extended shaking (12 minutes in original specifications, though 2-3 minutes with modern technique suffices) creates stable emulsion.

### Carbonation and Foam

Soda's CO2 interacts with foam differently than flat liquid:
- Rising bubbles can lift foam
- Aggressive pour destroys foam
- Gentle pour extends foam upward

For foamed fizzes (Ramos, Silver), pour soda into the center slowly, watching foam rise.

## Common Mistakes and Fixes

### Flat Drink

**Cause:** Shaking soda, over-stirring, warm soda.

**Fix:** Never shake soda, stir once only, use cold soda.

### No Foam (in egg drinks)

**Cause:** Insufficient dry shake.

**Fix:** Dry shake longer (30+ seconds).

### Separated Cream (Ramos)

**Cause:** Insufficient shaking.

**Fix:** Shake much longer. This drink is labor-intensive.

### Soda Overwhelms

**Cause:** Too much soda relative to base.

**Fix:** Reduce soda quantity. The base should still taste like a sour.

## The Ramos Challenge

The Ramos Gin Fizz deserves special attention because it's the most demanding drink in this chapter—possibly the most demanding classic cocktail, period.

**What makes it hard:**
- 8 ingredients (including cream and egg)
- Extended shaking required
- Foam must rise above rim
- All components must be integrated

**Tips for success:**
1. Dry shake aggressively for at least 30 seconds
2. Add ice, shake for another 30 seconds minimum
3. Use a Collins glass without ice
4. Pour soda very slowly into the center
5. The foam should push up above the rim

A perfect Ramos is a genuine achievement. Don't be discouraged by early attempts.
