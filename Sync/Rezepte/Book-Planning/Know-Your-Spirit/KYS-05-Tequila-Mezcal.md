# Chapter 5: Tequila & Mezcal - The Agave Spirits

No spirit carries its terroir more distinctly than those made from agave. The blue weber agave plant that becomes tequila takes eight to twelve years to mature—longer than most whiskey sits in barrels. When the jimador harvests that piña, he's cutting into nearly a decade of Mexican sunshine, volcanic soil, and highland or lowland air. That patience becomes flavor you can taste.

Tequila has suffered from its reputation as a shooter spirit, college party fuel to be quickly consumed with salt and lime. That reputation is changing. Today's premium tequilas rival the world's finest spirits in complexity and craftsmanship, while mezcal—tequila's smokier, more diverse cousin—has captured bartender imagination worldwide.

## The Story

### Pre-Columbian Origins

Long before Spanish colonizers arrived, indigenous Mexicans fermented agave into pulque, a milky, low-alcohol beverage with religious and cultural significance. The agave plant—particularly the heart, or piña—provided food, fiber, and drink. Fermented agave sustained civilizations.

But pulque wasn't distilled. The technology arrived with Spanish conquistadors, who brought copper stills and needed something to distill. When their brandy supplies ran low, they turned to local ingredients. Agave fermented well and distilled into something remarkable. Mezcal was born.

### Tequila Emerges

"Mezcal" originally referred to all distilled agave spirits. The town of Tequila, in Jalisco state, became known for exceptional production from blue weber agave. By the 18th century, "tequila" distinguished this regional style from broader mezcal production.

The Cuervo family received the first official license to produce tequila commercially in 1758. The Sauza family followed. These dynasties industrialized production, establishing the standards and styles that would define the category. By the late 1800s, tequila had become Mexico's national spirit.

### International Expansion

American Prohibition created demand for spirits south of the border. Tijuana and other border towns became drinking destinations. The Margarita may have been invented during this era—stories vary, but tequila cocktails definitely gained American popularity.

The 1970s-90s saw massive international growth, not always positive. Industrial production expanded to meet demand, quality suffered, and tequila's reputation sank. The spirit became associated with hangover-inducing shots rather than quality sipping.

### The Quality Revolution

The 21st century reversed tequila's slide. Several factors converged: Mexican regulations tightened, requiring 100% agave content for premium designations. Celebrity-backed brands (starting with Patrón's marketing success) proved premium tequila could command premium prices. Bartenders rediscovered classic tequila cocktails. Enthusiasts began treating tequila like single malt Scotch—evaluating terroir, production methods, and aging.

Today, tequila is one of the fastest-growing spirit categories globally. Demand has created agave shortages and price pressures, but also driven quality improvements across the board.

### Mezcal's Rise

While tequila industrialized, traditional mezcal production continued in Oaxaca and other Mexican states. Small-batch, artisanal mezcals preserved ancient techniques: roasting agave in underground pits, crushing with tahona stones, fermenting in wooden vats, distilling in clay pots.

International bartenders discovered these mezcals in the 2000s-2010s and fell in love with their complexity, smokiness, and authenticity. The cocktail renaissance embraced mezcal's distinctive character. Demand has grown exponentially, creating both opportunity and sustainability concerns for traditional producers.

## Production & Flavor

### The Agave Plant

Understanding tequila requires understanding agave. Blue weber agave (Agave tequilana) is a succulent—not a cactus—that stores complex sugars in its heart. The plant grows for 5-8 years (or longer in highland areas) before harvest. Farmers evaluate ripeness by appearance and sugar content, then cut away the leaves to expose the piña—a pineapple-shaped heart weighing 40-150 pounds.

The plant can only be harvested once. Unlike grain crops, which grow annually, agave production requires a decade of patience. This fundamental agriculture fact shapes everything about tequila's economics and character.

**Highland versus lowland:** Tequila's geography matters. Highland agaves (grown above 2,000 meters) mature more slowly, develop higher sugar content, and produce sweeter, more floral tequila. Lowland (valley) agaves grow faster, producing earthier, more herbaceous spirits. Both are legitimate—they're different expressions of the same plant.

### Tequila Production

**Cooking:** The piñas must be cooked to convert complex sugars into fermentable simple sugars. Traditional producers use brick ovens (hornos), slow-roasting for 24-72 hours. Industrial producers use autoclaves (pressure cookers), completing the process in hours. Horno-cooked agave develops more complex, caramelized flavors.

**Crushing:** Cooked agave must be crushed to extract juice. Traditional tahona wheels (volcanic stone pulled by mule or tractor) produce fiber-rich juice with earthy character. Mechanical shredders (diffusers) extract more efficiently but lose some complexity.

**Fermentation:** Extracted juice ferments in tanks—wood, steel, or concrete. Wild yeast fermentation takes longer and produces more complex results; commercial yeast is faster and more predictable. Fermentation length and temperature affect final flavor.

**Distillation:** Typically double-distilled in copper pot stills. Some producers use stainless steel, some use clay. The cut points (when distillers stop collecting hearts and begin tails) significantly affect character.

**Aging:** Unaged becomes blanco; aged becomes reposado, añejo, or extra añejo (more below).

### Mezcal Production

Traditional mezcal production differs significantly:

**Agave varieties:** While tequila uses only blue weber, mezcal can use over 30 agave species. Espadín is most common, but producers also use tobala, tepeztate, arroqueño, and others. Each variety has distinctive flavor—tobala tends toward floral complexity, tepeztate toward intense, wild character.

**Pit roasting:** The defining mezcal technique. Agave hearts are roasted in underground pits lined with hot rocks, then covered with earth. This slow (2-5 days) cooking caramelizes sugars and infuses smoky flavor from the fire and earth. The smoke distinguishes mezcal from tequila.

**Crushing:** Often by tahona or hand. Small producers may crush manually.

**Fermentation:** In wooden vats, often open-air with wild yeast. Takes days to weeks.

**Distillation:** Small pot stills, sometimes clay, typically double-distilled.

The result is more complex, more variable, and more intensely flavored than industrial tequila. Good mezcal should taste of smoke, yes, but also fruit, minerals, earth, and specific agave character.

### Aging Categories

**Blanco (also called silver or plata):** Unaged or rested briefly. Pure agave character. Best for cocktails and evaluating distillery style.

**Reposado ("rested"):** Aged 2 months to 1 year. Light gold color, subtle wood influence. Balances agave character with barrel smoothness. Versatile for sipping or mixing.

**Añejo ("aged"):** Aged 1-3 years. Deeper color, more pronounced barrel character. Sweet, complex, whiskey-like. Better for sipping, but can work in spirit-forward cocktails.

**Extra Añejo:** Aged 3+ years. Deep amber, heavy barrel influence. Often compared to fine Cognac. Strictly sipping spirit.

**Joven/Gold:** Usually blanco blended with aged tequila or colored/flavored with caramel. The cheap gold tequilas that gave the category a bad name. Avoid unless specifically crafted by quality producers.

## How to Taste Agave Spirits

### Setup

Room temperature, tulip-shaped glass. Agave spirits benefit from aeration—pour and let sit for a few minutes before nosing.

### What to Look For

**Appearance:** Blancos should be crystal clear. Reposados show pale gold. Añejos range from amber to deep bronze. Color indicates aging but can be manipulated with caramel coloring in mixto tequilas.

**Nose:** First, assess agave presence—you should smell the plant: vegetal, slightly sweet, earthy. Then identify additional notes: citrus, pepper, herbs for blancos; vanilla, caramel, oak for aged expressions. Mezcal should show smoke alongside agave character.

**Palate:** Entry should be smooth, not harsh. Good tequila tastes of agave first, then shows spice, citrus, or earth. Aged expressions add vanilla, caramel, and oak sweetness. Mezcal brings smoke that should integrate with other flavors, not dominate.

**Finish:** Clean, warm, with lingering agave presence. Aged expressions have longer finishes with barrel influence. Mezcal's smoke often persists pleasantly.

### Quality Indicators

**"100% Agave" on label:** Essential. "Mixto" tequilas can contain 49% non-agave sugars (usually cane) and are inferior.

**NOM number:** Every registered tequila distillery has a Norma Oficial Mexicana number. Look it up to understand who actually made your tequila—many brands contract production.

**Additive-free:** Some producers add flavorings, colorings, and glycerin. "Additive-free" certification (increasingly available) indicates pure product.

## In Cocktails

Agave spirits have become essential to modern cocktail culture. Their distinctive character creates drinks impossible to replicate with other spirits.

### Essential Tequila Cocktails

**Margarita:** The classic. Tequila, lime juice, orange liqueur. Proportions vary; 2:1:1 is common. Use blanco for freshness, reposado for smoothness. The cocktail that introduced millions to tequila's potential.

**Tommy's Margarita:** Julio Bermejo's variation from San Francisco. Tequila, lime, agave syrup—no orange liqueur. Puts tequila front and center. Many bartenders prefer this to the original.

**Paloma:** Tequila's highball. Tequila, grapefruit soda, lime, salt. Mexico's most popular tequila drink, underrated internationally. Refreshing, slightly bitter, dangerously drinkable.

**El Diablo:** Tequila, lime, ginger beer, crème de cassis. The tequila Buck, with blackcurrant complexity. More interesting than it sounds.

**Batanga:** Don Javier Delgado Corona's invention. Tequila, lime, Coca-Cola. Rustic but legitimately good.

**Tequila Sunrise:** Tequila, orange juice, grenadine. Visual spectacle, breakfast cocktail vibes.

### Essential Mezcal Cocktails

**Mezcal Margarita:** Substitute mezcal for tequila. Smoke transforms the familiar into something new.

**Oaxaca Old Fashioned:** Phil Ward's modern classic. Tequila, mezcal, agave syrup, bitters. The cocktail that made mezcal essential in American bars.

**Naked and Famous:** Equal parts mezcal, yellow Chartreuse, Aperol, lime. Modern classic from Death & Co. Smoky, herbal, bitter, perfect.

**Division Bell:** Mezcal, Aperol, maraschino, lime. Similar template, different balance.

### Choosing for Cocktails

**Margarita/Tommy's:** Blanco tequila with strong agave character. Highland tequilas bring sweetness; lowland bring earthiness. Both work.

**Sipping cocktails (Old Fashioned style):** Reposado's barrel influence smooths and sweetens. Añejo for special occasions.

**Mezcal cocktails:** Espadín mezcal works universally. Save rare single-estate mezcals for sipping.
