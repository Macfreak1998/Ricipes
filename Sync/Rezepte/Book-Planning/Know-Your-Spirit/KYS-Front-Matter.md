## A Note on Prices

Prices referenced throughout this book reflect approximate US retail costs as of 2025. Prices vary by region, retailer, and market conditions. Use price tiers (entry, mid-range, premium) as general guidance rather than exact figures.

## A Note on Availability

Some spirits mentioned may be difficult to find in certain markets. The craft spirit revolution has created thousands of products; not all reach every retailer. Recommendations include widely-available options where possible, with specialty items noted.

## A Note on Taste

Tasting notes reflect consensus opinions and the author's experience. Taste is personal. Use descriptions as starting points for your own evaluation, not absolute judgments.
