# Chapter 3: Gin - From Medicine to Martini

Gin saved the British Navy, built an empire, and nearly destroyed London's poor. Today, it's having its greatest renaissance in three hundred years, with craft distillers worldwide creating expressions that medieval genever-makers couldn't have imagined. No spirit has traveled such a dramatic arc from medicine to menace to modern classic.

At its core, gin is simplicity itself: neutral spirit flavored with juniper. But within that definition lies infinite variation—from the bone-dry austerity of a classic London Dry to the floral explosion of contemporary botanical gins. Understanding gin means understanding how tradition and innovation coexist in the same glass.

## The Story

### Dutch Origins: Genever

Gin began as genever in the Low Countries during the 16th century. Dutch and Flemish distillers added juniper and other botanicals to harsh grain spirits, partly for flavor, partly because juniper had supposed medicinal properties. The word "genever" comes from *jeneverbes*, Dutch for juniper berry.

Genever was serious medicine. Dutch doctors prescribed it for kidney ailments, stomach troubles, and gout. Soldiers drank it before battle—hence "Dutch courage." When English troops fighting in the Low Countries discovered genever, they brought the taste (and the habit) home.

### The Gin Craze

The real story begins in 1689 when William of Orange, a Dutch Protestant, took the English throne. William encouraged domestic distilling, partly to break France's brandy monopoly, partly because he genuinely liked Dutch spirits. He made distilling easier, cheaper, and legal for almost anyone.

The result was catastrophic. By 1730, London had over 7,000 gin shops—one for every six houses in some neighborhoods. Gin became impossibly cheap: "Drunk for a penny, dead drunk for tuppence." Unlike beer, which required brewing equipment, gin could be made in a bathtub with minimal materials.

William Hogarth's famous prints "Beer Street" and "Gin Lane" captured the moral panic. The latter shows gin-addled mothers dropping infants, corpses being loaded into coffins, and general social collapse. The imagery was propaganda, but the underlying crisis was real.

The Gin Acts of the 1730s-1750s attempted to control the trade through licensing and taxation. They largely failed until the government finally found the right balance: making gin expensive enough to prevent mass abuse while keeping it legal enough to prevent dangerous black markets. By 1760, the crisis had passed.

### The Victorian Rehabilitation

The 19th century transformed gin's reputation. The invention of the column still enabled production of purer, cleaner spirits. The British Empire's expansion created demand for portable, preservable drinks. And the tonic water prescribed for malaria combined perfectly with gin—creating the G&T that would define colonial drinking.

Gin palaces—ornate, gas-lit establishments—replaced squalid gin shops. The spirit became respectable, associated with the officer class rather than London's poor. Brands like Gordon's, Beefeater, and Tanqueray established the London Dry style that remains dominant today.

### The American Century

Prohibition sent Americans to Europe, where they discovered cocktails built on gin. The Martini, the Negroni, the French 75—all achieved their classic forms in this era. After repeal, gin dominated American cocktail culture for decades.

Vodka's rise in the 1960s-80s pushed gin aside. The Martini became a vodka drink. Gin seemed old-fashioned, associated with grandmother's liquor cabinet.

### The Craft Renaissance

The 21st century brought gin's resurrection. Craft distillers discovered gin's accessibility: unlike whiskey, it doesn't require years of aging. Small batches were economically viable. The spirit invited experimentation with local botanicals, unusual flavor profiles, and innovative techniques.

Today, more gin styles exist than at any point in history. Every country has craft gin producers. The boundaries keep expanding—from Japanese gin using yuzu and sansho pepper to Spanish gin infused with Mediterranean herbs. The gin craze is back, but this time it's about quality, not chaos.

## Production & Flavor

### The Juniper Requirement

Legally and definitionally, gin must taste predominantly of juniper. Without juniper dominance, it's not gin—it's flavored vodka. This seems restrictive, but juniper's pine-resin character actually provides a foundation that supports endless botanical combinations.

Juniper berries aren't really berries—they're seed cones from juniper trees. Their flavor comes from essential oils, primarily alpha-pinene (pine) and myrcene (herbal). Different juniper sources produce different flavor profiles: Italian juniper is regarded as particularly aromatic.

### The Botanical Bill

Beyond juniper, distillers create complexity through additional botanicals. Common additions include:

**Citrus peels:** Orange, lemon, grapefruit—provide brightness and lift
**Coriander:** The second-most common botanical; adds warmth and spice
**Angelica root:** Earthy, dry; helps bind other flavors together
**Orris root:** From iris flowers; provides structure and violet notes
**Cardamom:** Warm, exotic spice
**Cassia bark:** Cinnamon-like; adds warmth
**Licorice root:** Natural sweetness; smooth mouthfeel
**Almonds:** Nutty, marzipan notes
**Cubeb berries:** Peppery, complex

Modern gins go far beyond this traditional roster. Cucumber, rose petals, lavender, tea, seaweed, local herbs—anything that harmonizes with juniper can become a botanical.

### Production Methods

**Compound gin:** The simplest method. Add botanicals or extracts to neutral spirit without redistilling. Legal in some categories but produces less refined results. Most cheap gins are compound.

**Distilled gin:** Redistill neutral spirit with botanicals. The distillation process extracts and integrates flavors more elegantly than steeping. Required for London Dry designation.

**Vapor infusion:** Botanicals are placed in a basket above the spirit during distillation. Rising vapor passes through, extracting delicate flavors without the harshness of direct contact. Bombay Sapphire popularized this method.

**Multiple methods combined:** Many craft distillers use different techniques for different botanicals—distilling robust ingredients, vapor-infusing delicate ones, perhaps macerating others—then blending the results.

### Geographic Styles

**London Dry:** Despite the name, can be made anywhere. Defined by restrictions: no added sugar (beyond trace amounts), no artificial flavors, all botanicals added before or during distillation. Typically juniper-forward, dry, crisp. Classic brands: Beefeater, Tanqueray, Sipsmith.

**Plymouth:** Geographically protected; must be made in Plymouth, England. Currently only one distillery produces it. Slightly sweeter and earthier than London Dry, with more root influence.

**Old Tom:** A historical style, sweeter than London Dry but not syrupy. Important in classic cocktails like the Tom Collins and Martinez. Was nearly extinct; now revived by craft producers.

**Genever:** The Dutch original. Made with malt wine (grain spirit from pot still) plus botanicals. Maltier, richer, more whiskey-like than English gins. Categorized as oude (old, maltier) or jonge (young, lighter).

**New Western/Contemporary:** A catch-all for modern gins that emphasize botanicals other than juniper. Hendrick's (cucumber, rose) pioneered this category. Includes everything from citrus-driven to herbal to floral.

**Navy Strength:** Bottled at 57% ABV or higher—the concentration at which gunpowder soaked in the spirit still ignites. Big, bold, and designed to punch through cocktails. Not a style per se, but a strength category.

## How to Taste Gin

### Setup

Use a tulip-shaped glass or small wine glass. Pour 15-20ml neat. Have water available to add drops and open the spirit.

### What to Look For

**Appearance:** Should be crystal clear. Any color indicates additives or infusion (not necessarily negative, but notable).

**Nose:** First, juniper—pine, resin, forest. Then supporting botanicals: citrus lift, coriander warmth, floral notes, earthy depth. Well-made gin presents a coherent bouquet; cheap gin smells of harsh alcohol with perfume overlay.

**Palate:** The entry should be clean, not burning. Juniper should assert itself, then fade as other botanicals speak. Look for integration—do the flavors work together or fight? Note the texture: should be smooth with slight viscosity, not thin or oily.

**Finish:** Clean, dry, refreshing. Lingering herbal notes are desirable. Harsh alcohol burn is not. The finish should make you want another sip.

### Comparative Tasting

Line up three gins: a classic London Dry (Beefeater), a contemporary style (Hendrick's), and something experimental (your choice). Taste through, noting how juniper balance shifts. The London Dry will be most juniper-forward; the contemporary will emphasize other botanicals while keeping juniper present; the experimental may push juniper to the background.

## In Cocktails

Gin's botanical complexity makes it cocktail royalty. It brings flavor without heaviness, plays well with vermouth and citrus, and provides structure to virtually any recipe.

### Essential Gin Cocktails

**Martini:** The benchmark. Gin plus dry vermouth, proportions debated eternally. Showcases gin's quality directly—bad gin makes bad Martinis. A 4:1 ratio lets gin shine while vermouth adds complexity.

**Negroni:** Equal parts gin, sweet vermouth, Campari. The gin's botanicals counterbalance Campari's bitterness. A perfect integration of three strong personalities.

**Gin & Tonic:** Simplicity perfected. Quality gin, quality tonic, proper proportion (2:3 or 1:2), good ice. Different gins pair with different tonics—experiment to find your preference.

**Tom Collins:** Gin, lemon juice, sugar, soda water. A template for refreshment. Demonstrates gin's affinity for citrus.

**French 75:** Gin, lemon juice, sugar, champagne. Elegant, celebratory, and dangerously drinkable.

**Last Word:** Equal parts gin, Chartreuse, maraschino, lime. The cocktail renaissance's poster child, rescued from obscurity to become a modern classic.

**Aviation:** Gin, maraschino, lemon, crème de violette. Floral, balanced, and beautiful pale purple.

**Bee's Knees:** Gin, lemon, honey syrup. Prohibition-era cocktail designed to mask bathtub gin's harshness; now showcases good gin beautifully.

### Choosing Gin for Cocktails

**Martini/Negroni:** Use a London Dry with strong juniper character. You need gin that stands up to vermouth and/or Campari.

**G&T:** Match gin to tonic. Floral gins with Indian tonic; citrus-forward gins with Mediterranean tonic; classic London Dry with classic Schweppes.

**Citrus cocktails:** Contemporary gins often work beautifully, as their lighter juniper profile harmonizes with lemon/lime.

**Navy strength:** When you want gin to punch through. In cocktails with many ingredients or significant dilution, 57% ABV ensures the gin isn't lost.
