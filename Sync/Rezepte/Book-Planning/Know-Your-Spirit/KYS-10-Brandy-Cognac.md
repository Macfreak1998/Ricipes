# Chapter 10: Brandy & Cognac - The Grape Spirits

The word "brandy" comes from Dutch *brandewijn*—burnt wine. The name captures the essence: brandy is distilled wine, grape's essence concentrated through fire and copper. Where whiskey speaks of grain and oak, brandy speaks of vineyard and vintage, of French terroir and centuries of refinement.

Cognac dominates brandy's prestige, but the category encompasses far more: Armagnac's rustic intensity, Calvados's apple elegance, Pisco's South American tradition, and American brandy's recent renaissance. Understanding brandy means understanding how grape transforms through distillation and time.

## The Story

### Dutch Innovation

Brandy emerged from practical commerce. Dutch traders in the 16th and 17th centuries needed to transport French wine efficiently. Wine spoiled during long voyages and took up cargo space. Distilling concentrated the wine, preserved it, and reduced volume. Upon arrival, the spirit could theoretically be reconstituted with water.

But traders discovered that concentrated wine tasted better than diluted wine. The distilled product—*brandewijn*—became valuable in its own right. French wine regions that initially resisted distillation as debasement eventually embraced it as opportunity.

### Cognac Emerges

The Cognac region, centered on the Charente River in southwest France, proved ideal for brandy production. The chalky soil grew grapes with high acidity and low sugar—poor wine but excellent distillation material. The proximity to Atlantic shipping routes provided access to international markets.

By the 1600s, Cognac had established its reputation. Dutch merchants partnered with French distillers. The major houses—Martell (1715), Rémy Martin (1724), Hennessy (1765), Courvoisier (1809)—emerged to serve global demand.

Cognac earned Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (AOC) protection in 1936, defining the geographic boundaries and production methods that distinguish authentic Cognac from other brandy.

### Armagnac: The Other French Brandy

Armagnac predates Cognac by perhaps 200 years—records from 1310 mention Armagnac distillation. Yet Armagnac never achieved Cognac's commercial success, partly due to geography (farther from shipping routes) and partly due to industry fragmentation.

Where Cognac houses consolidated and professionalized, Armagnac remained largely a region of small producers. This preserved traditional methods—single continuous distillation versus Cognac's double pot distillation—but limited marketing power.

Today, Armagnac attracts enthusiasts who appreciate its rustic, intense character and the availability of vintage-dated bottlings that Cognac rarely offers.

### American Brandy

American brandy has a longer history than most realize. Spanish missions planted vineyards in California by the 1770s, and brandy production followed. By Prohibition, California brandy was substantial industry.

Post-Prohibition California brandy focused on volume rather than quality, producing inexpensive spirits for mixing. But recent decades have seen craft revival. Producers like Germain-Robin, Osocalis, and Copper & Kings are demonstrating that American brandy can achieve excellence.

### Other Traditions

**Calvados:** Apple brandy from Normandy, France. Aged in oak, ranging from fresh and fruity to complex and cognac-like.

**Pisco:** South American grape spirit from Peru and Chile. Unaged, showcasing pure distillate character.

**Grappa:** Italian pomace brandy made from grape skins, seeds, and stems left after winemaking. Raw, aggressive when young; complex when aged.

**Spanish Brandy de Jerez:** Aged in sherry casks using solera system. Sweet, oxidized character.

## Production & Flavor

### The Grapes

Cognac uses specific grape varieties, primarily Ugni Blanc (Trebbiano)—high acid, low sugar, minimal aromatic character. These qualities, negative for wine, prove positive for distillation: high acid preserves freshness, low sugar keeps alcohol manageable, and neutral character provides a clean canvas for aging.

Armagnac permits more grape varieties, including Baco Blanc, Folle Blanche, and Ugni Blanc. This variety allows more expression in the final spirit.

American and other brandies use whatever wine grapes grow locally—Colombard, Pinot Noir, Thompson Seedless, and many others.

### Distillation Methods

**Cognac double distillation:** Cognac uses small copper pot stills (alembics) for two separate distillations. The first produces *brouillis* (about 30% ABV); the second produces *bonne chauffe* (about 70% ABV). This method requires careful attention to cuts and produces refined, elegant spirit.

**Armagnac single distillation:** Traditional Armagnac uses continuous column stills (alambic armagnacais) for single distillation at lower proof. The result retains more congeners—fuller, more rustic spirit. Some producers now use double distillation similar to Cognac.

**Other methods:** Calvados uses both pot and column stills depending on appellation. Pisco is distilled in various still types. American brandy varies by producer.

### The Aging Question

**Cognac aging designations:**
- VS (Very Special): Minimum 2 years in oak
- VSOP (Very Superior Old Pale): Minimum 4 years
- XO (Extra Old): Minimum 10 years (changed from 6 in 2018)
- Hors d'Age: Often older than XO minimum; no legal definition

These designations indicate minimum age of the youngest component—the blend may contain much older spirits.

**Armagnac aging:** Same basic designations but with different interpretations. Armagnac also offers vintage dating—brandy from a single harvest year, aged minimum 10 years. Cognac rarely offers true vintage expressions.

**Barrel influence:** French oak (Limousin and Tronçais) dominates both Cognac and Armagnac. New oak contributes aggressively; used oak contributes subtly. Extended aging in used oak develops complexity without excessive tannin.

### Blending Art

Most commercial Cognac and Armagnac involves blending spirits of different ages and vineyard origins. The cellar master (*maître de chai*) creates consistency and complexity by combining components. This is skilled work—the blender must understand how spirits will develop and interact.

Single-estate, vintage-dated, and single-cask releases offer alternatives to blended products, showcasing specific character rather than house style.

## How to Taste Brandy

### Setup

Room temperature or slightly warmed (hands around the glass). Traditional balloon snifters work but can concentrate alcohol too intensely—tulip glasses often work better. Brandy deserves slow appreciation.

### What to Look For

**Appearance:** Color darkens with age—pale gold for young VS, deep amber to mahogany for old XO. Legs indicate body and alcohol.

**Nose:** Young brandy shows fresh fruit—grape, apple, pear. Aged brandy develops dried fruit (fig, date, raisin), spice (vanilla, cinnamon), nuttiness, and complex tertiary notes (leather, tobacco, chocolate). Great aged brandy has endless nose development.

**Palate:** Entry should be smooth for quality brandy. Look for fruit character appropriate to age, balanced sweetness, oak integration, and complexity. Young brandy may show heat; old brandy should be silky.

**Finish:** Length matters. Fine aged brandy finishes for minutes, with flavors evolving. Short finish indicates youth or inferior quality.

### Comparative Approach

Taste across age categories: VS (young, fresh), VSOP (developing, balanced), XO (mature, complex). The progression demonstrates how time transforms spirit.

Then taste across categories: Cognac (refined, elegant), Armagnac (rustic, intense), Calvados (apple character). Each tradition expresses brandy differently.

## In Cocktails

Brandy was the original cocktail spirit—many drinks now made with whiskey originally used brandy. The category's decline means brandy cocktails are underexplored today, offering opportunities for rediscovery.

### Essential Brandy Cocktails

**Sidecar:** The benchmark brandy cocktail. Cognac, Cointreau, lemon juice. The template for sour cocktails, elegant and balanced. Use VSOP for complexity without overwhelming age.

**French 75 (original):** Often made with gin today, but the original used Cognac. Brandy, lemon, sugar, champagne. Rich and celebratory.

**Brandy Alexander:** Brandy, crème de cacao, cream. Dessert cocktail with surprising depth. Quality Cognac makes a difference.

**Vieux Carré:** Rye, Cognac, sweet vermouth, Bénédictine, bitters. New Orleans complexity. The Cognac adds depth without dominating.

**Sazerac (original):** Originally made with Cognac before rye became standard. Try the original recipe for historical perspective.

**Between the Sheets:** Cognac, rum, Cointreau, lemon. Sidecar variation with added complexity.

**Champagne Cocktail:** Sugar, bitters, Champagne, Cognac float. Simple elegance.

**Jack Rose:** Apple brandy (Calvados or American), lemon, grenadine. Shows apple brandy's versatility.

### Choosing for Cocktails

**Standard cocktails:** Use VS or young VSOP. Older brandy's complexity can be lost in mixed drinks.

**Spirit-forward cocktails:** VSOP provides balance—enough character to assert itself, not so much that you're wasting premium spirit.

**Premium cocktails:** XO makes exceptional Sidecars for special occasions, but the investment is significant.
