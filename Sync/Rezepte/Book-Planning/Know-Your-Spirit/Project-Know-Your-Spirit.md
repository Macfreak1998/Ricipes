## Notes & Ideas

### Hook for Introduction
"Every spirit behind your bar has a story. Rum fueled the Caribbean economy and naval empires. Gin started as medicine and became the British Empire's drink. Bourbon built Kentucky, survived Prohibition, and defined American drinking. Tequila rose from Mexican tradition to global phenomenon. Understanding these stories doesn't just make you more knowledgeable—it makes every drink taste better."

### Chapter Opening Hook Examples
- **Gin**: "Gin saved the British Navy, built an empire, and nearly destroyed London's poor. Today, it's having its greatest renaissance in 300 years."
- **Bourbon**: "There's no such thing as 'Kentucky whiskey.' If it's made in Kentucky from corn, aged in charred new oak, and meets legal requirements, it's bourbon. And bourbon is America's only native spirit."
- **Rum**: "Rum built the Caribbean, fueled the slave trade, powered naval fleets, and created tiki culture. It's the most diverse spirit on earth—and the most misunderstood."
- **Chartreuse**: "Only three monks know the recipe. It's been the same since 1737. And it's still the most complex liqueur ever made."

### Special Elements
- **"Historical Spotlight" boxes**: Deep dive into key moments
- **"Production Note" sidebars**: Specific technical details
- **"Tasting Challenge" exercises**: Build your palate
- **"Cocktail Showcase" boxes**: Essential drinks for each spirit
