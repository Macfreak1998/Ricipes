# The Negroni Family

The Negroni family represents one of the most influential cocktail lineages in modern bartending. Built on the simple 1:1:1 formula of spirit, bitter liqueur, and vermouth, this family shows how one template can generate endless variations.

---

## The Original Formula

**Classic Negroni** (1919)
- 1 oz [[Gin]]
- 1 oz [[Campari]]
- 1 oz [[Sweet Vermouth]]
- Stirred, served on rocks with orange garnish

**The Philosophy**: Equal parts creates perfect balance. The gin provides botanical backbone, Campari brings bitter complexity, and sweet vermouth ties it together.

## The Ancestors

### Americano (1860s)
**The Negroni's grandfather**
- [[Campari]]
- [[Sweet Vermouth]]
- [[Soda Water]]
- Served over ice with orange

**Connection**: Count Negroni asked his bartender to "strengthen" his Americano by replacing soda with gin. The Negroni was born.

### Milano-Torino (Pre-1860)
**The original template**
- [[Campari]] (from Milan)
- [[Sweet Vermouth]] (from Turin)

**Connection**: The Americano added soda to this combination. These three drinks form the evolutionary chain.

## The Direct Variations

### Boulevardier (1927)
**The whiskey Negroni**
- [[Bourbon]] or [[Rye Whiskey]] replaces gin
- [[Campari]]
- [[Sweet Vermouth]]

**Why it works**: Whiskey's caramel notes complement Campari's bitterness differently than gin. Richer, warmer character.

**Book angle**: Perfect for showing how base spirit changes completely alter a cocktail's personality while keeping the structure.

### Negroni Sbagliato (1960s)
**The "mistaken" Negroni**
- [[Prosecco]] or [[Champagne]] replaces gin
- [[Campari]]
- [[Sweet Vermouth]]

**Story**: "Sbagliato" means "mistaken" in Italian. Legend says a bartender grabbed prosecco instead of gin by mistake. The error became a classic.

**Why it works**: Lower ABV, effervescent, more aperitif-friendly. Perfect for afternoon drinking.

### White Negroni (2001)
**The modern twist**
- [[Gin]]
- [[Suze]] or [[Gentian Liqueur]] replaces Campari
- [[Lillet Blanc]] or [[Blanc Vermouth]] replaces sweet vermouth

**Story**: Created at London's Duke Hotel by Wayne Collins. Uses gentian (Suze) for bitterness instead of Campari.

**Why it works**: Lighter, more floral, different kind of bitter. Shows that the formula works with completely different ingredients.

## Regional & Specialized Variations

### Enzoni
**The Negroni-Gimlet hybrid**
- [[Gin]]
- [[Campari]]
- [[Lemon Juice]]

- Muddled grapes

**Book angle**: Shows how adding citrus transforms the formula into a shaken drink.

### Kingston Negroni
**The rum variation**
- [[Jamaican Rum]] or [[Dark Rum]]
- [[Campari]]
- [[Sweet Vermouth]]

**Why it matters**: Demonstrates how any base spirit works with the Campari-vermouth combination.

### Mezcal Negroni
**The smoky version**
- [[Mezcal]]
- [[Campari]]
- [[Sweet Vermouth]]

**Why it's interesting**: Mezcal's smoke adds another dimension to the bitter-sweet balance.

- [[Rye Whiskey]]
- [[Campari]]
- [[Dry Vermouth]] (note: dry instead of sweet)

## The Formula's Genius

### Why This Template Works

1. **Equal parts = Idiot-proof**: No complicated ratios to remember
2. **Spirit-Bitter-Sweet**: The three-part structure is fundamental
3. **Infinite substitution**: Change any element, keep the structure

5. **Room for expression**: Bartenders can showcase different spirits or amari
