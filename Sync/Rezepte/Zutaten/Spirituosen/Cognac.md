# Cognac

## Beschreibung
Cognac is the most famous and prestigious brandy in the world. Only brandies from the legally defined region around Cognac (not Bordeaux) in France can be called Cognac. The chalky soils, the climate, and the proximity to the sea are unique to this wine region, producing a thin, acidic white wine with excellent character for distillation.

## Herstellung
The distillation of Cognac is based on traditions dating back to the 17th century. The wine is double-distilled in copper pot stills. The first distillation produces a liquid with approximately 30% alcohol, while the second distillation (the "heart cut") yields a distillate of about 140° proof (approximately 70% alcohol), representing the best and most harmonious output.

### The Six Growing Regions of Charente
1. **Grande Champagne**: The highest quality area. Grapes from this district produce the finest, most aromatic Cognacs, which are double-distilled. Cognacs from Grande Champagne require longer aging.

2. **Petite Champagne**: 20% of wines for Cognac come from this area. A blend of Grande and Petite Champagne (at least 50% Grande) is designated as "Fine Champagne."

3. **Les Borderies**: The wines from this region produce a mild Cognac with a rich bouquet. They represent about 5% of Cognac production.

4. **Les Bois**: The largest vineyard area along the river, with three grape varieties: Ugni Blanc, Colombard, and Folle Blanche.

5. **Fins Bois**: About 43% of the wines used in Cognac production come from this robust coastal area.

6. **Bois Ordinaires**: This area accounts for about 3% of total Cognac production.

### Reifung
Cognac is aged in oak barrels for several years (at least two years for the US market). These wooden containers are porous, allowing the Cognac to slowly oxidize while the brandy also evaporates from the barrel (the "angel's share"). This process transforms a harsh distillate into a smooth, harmonious spirit with desirable flavors - from vanilla to the intense concentration of older Cognacs.

Before bottling, Cognac is typically diluted with distilled water and "faibles" (weak Cognac) to at least 80° proof (40% alcohol). Some caramel may also be added to maintain color consistency.

With few exceptions, Cognac is always a blend of individual Cognacs of various ages, sources, and vintages. This blending is performed to ensure the character and quality of each brand remains consistent over time.

### Altersbezeichnungen
Cognac labels carry various designations and initials, stars, and phrases from which the minimum age of the Cognac can be derived. The stated age always refers to the number of years the youngest ingredient has spent in the barrel.

**Minimum age of two years** (from April 1st after distillation):
- ★★★ (three or more stars): V.S., V.S.P.

**Minimum age of four years**:
- V.S.O.P., V.O.

**Minimum age of six years**:
- Extra, Napoléon, X.O.

**Note**: There is no official designation for Cognacs older than six years. Often proprietary names such as Triomphe, Très Vénérable, Paradis, etc. are used.

## Verwendung in Cocktails
Cognac is used in classic cocktails such as the Sidecar, French 75, Brandy Crusta, and many others. It can also be enjoyed neat or on ice.
