## Beschreibung

Italicus Rosolio di Bergamotto is a modern Italian bergamot liqueur created in 2016 by Giuseppe Gallo, reviving a historical category: the Rosolio, a traditional Italian liqueur from Renaissance times. At 20% alcohol, Italicus presents an elegant, complex profile that places bergamot at the center - that aromatic citrus fruit that comes mainly from Calabria and is primarily known for its essential oil, which is used in Earl Grey tea.

The taste profile is a refined balance of citrus, flowers and herbs. Bergamot delivers an intense but not overpowering citrus note with floral undertones. Added to this are Italian botanicals such as chamomile, lavender, lemon balm, gentian and rose, which give the liqueur depth and an almost perfume-like elegance. Unlike many citrus liqueurs, Italicus is less sweet and presents more complexity and balance, making it more versatile in cocktails.

Production involves macerating the various botanicals in pure wheat alcohol, supplemented by distillates of cedar fruits and bergamot. The liqueur is then rounded off with a delicate sugar from Sicily. The bottle itself is a work of art - inspired by ancient Roman glass vessels and decorated with gold accents that reference the luxurious heritage of the Rosolio tradition.

In modern mixology, Italicus has quickly made a name for itself, especially in Spritz variations and gin-based cocktails. It works excellently as a replacement or complement to other liqueurs in classic recipes - for example, it can give a Negroni an interesting citrus-floral dimension. The liqueur shines especially in combination with Prosecco, Champagne, Gin and Vodka, and its floral complexity makes it ideal for spring and summer drinks. Typical dosages range from 0.75 to 1.5 oz.

## Verwendung in Cocktails

Italicus works beautifully in contemporary Italian cocktails like the Italicus Spritz (Italicus, Prosecco, soda) or as a modifier in gin-based drinks. Its bergamot profile pairs wonderfully with [[Gin]], [[Vodka]], and sparkling wines. Popular serves include the Italicus & Tonic, where it creates an elegant, perfumed highball. In stirred cocktails, it can add floral complexity without overwhelming other ingredients.
