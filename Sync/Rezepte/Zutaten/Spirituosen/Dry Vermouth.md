# Dry Vermouth

## Beschreibung
Dry Vermouth, also called French Vermouth or Blanc, is the dry, botanically aromatic variant of vermouth - essential for Martinis and a wonderful cocktail modifier. Like sweet vermouth, dry vermouth is an aromatized, fortified wine, strengthened to 16-18% ABV and aromatized with botanicals (herbs, spices, roots). The difference lies in the significantly lower sweetness and the lighter color profile.

Dry vermouth shows an almost clear to pale yellow color and a more elegant, drier taste than sweet vermouth. The botanicals stand more in the foreground - think white flowers, chamomile, wormwood (the namesake ingredient), citrus peels, and fine spice notes. There is a slight residual sweetness, but significantly less than in sweet vermouth. French brands like Dolin Dry and Noilly Prat are classic, but Spanish vermouths like La Quintinye also show excellent profiles.

Like all vermouths, dry vermouth is perishable and should be stored in the refrigerator after opening, where it keeps for about 3-4 weeks. Oxidation is particularly problematic with dry vermouth, as the delicate botanicals quickly become flat and musty. In cocktails, dry vermouth brings botanical complexity without heavy sweetness - perfect for drinks that need elegance and finesse. The classic Dry Martini perfectly demonstrates the role of dry vermouth: it opens up the gin, adds herbal notes, and creates a smoother texture.
