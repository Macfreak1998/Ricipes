# Reposado Tequila

## Beschreibung
Reposado Tequila is "rested" tequila - aged between 2 and 12 months in oak barrels, typically former bourbon barrels. "Reposado" literally means "rested" in Spanish. This category offers the perfect balance between the fresh agave intensity of blanco and the woody, spicy notes of longer aging.

Barrel aging gives Reposado a golden color and develops vanilla, caramel, and light spice notes, while preserving the characteristic agave character. The flavor shows the peppery, grassy quality of agave, complemented by gentle wood notes, honey, and spices. At 38-40% ABV, Reposado is smoother than blanco but livelier than the heavily aged añejo.

In cocktails, Reposado brings more complexity than blanco without being too dominant. Perfect for premium margaritas where you want both agave character and depth, or in spirit-forward drinks like [[Tommy's Margarita]]. The added smoothness also makes Reposado excellent for sipping neat.

## Verwendung in Cocktails
Reposado works perfectly in premium [[Margarita]]s, [[Paloma]]s, and anywhere you seek balance between agave freshness and aged complexity. Also excellent in Old Fashioned variations.
