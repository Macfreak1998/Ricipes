# Fernet

## Beschreibung

Fernet is an extremely bitter subcategory of amaro (Italian bitter liqueur) that is characterized by its intense, almost medicinal bitterness and complex herbal aromatics. While "amaro" generally means "bitter," Fernet stands for a particularly uncompromising bitter expression. The most famous brand is Fernet-Branca, but there are many other Fernets with their own recipes. The alcohol content is typically 39-45% ABV.

Production occurs through maceration of a complex mixture of herbs, spices, roots, and other botanicals - often 27-40+ ingredients - in alcohol. Fernet-Branca reportedly uses 27 herbs from five continents, with the exact recipe being a closely guarded secret. Characteristic ingredients include myrrh, rhubarb, chamomile, cardamom, saffron, and especially peppermint, which gives Fernet its cooling, mentholated quality.

The taste profile is intense and polarizing: dominant bitterness, mentholated coolness, herbal complexity, and often notes of eucalyptus, anise, dark chocolate, and earthy spices. Fernet is not sweet - it is bone-dry with an almost aggressively bitter character. The first encounter with Fernet is often challenging, but many develop a deep love for this complex, unadulterated style.

In Italy, Fernet is traditionally drunk as a digestif after heavy meals - ice-cold in a small glass. The theory: the bitterness is supposed to stimulate digestion. In Buenos Aires, Argentina, Fernet-Branca with Cola is a national drink ("Fernet con Cola"), especially among younger people. This cultural adoption shows the different ways Fernet is consumed.

## Verwendung in Cocktails

In cocktails, Fernet is typically used in the smallest doses - often as a "rinse" (rinse the glass with it and then discard) or in amounts of 0.25-0.5 oz. A famous Fernet cocktail is the Hanky Panky (Gin, Sweet Vermouth, Fernet), where a small splash of Fernet gives the drink a fascinating bitter depth.

Modern bartenders use Fernet as a complexity booster in various cocktails - a few dashes can transform a Manhattan or Negroni. In bartender culture, Fernet-Branca has established itself as the "bartender's handshake" - a shot that bartenders offer each other at the end of a shift. It is a sign of belonging and mutual respect in the industry.

For the home bar, Fernet is optional and primarily for enthusiasts and the experimentally minded. If you buy it, start with small amounts in cocktails - the intensity can be overwhelming. Over time, many develop an appreciation for this uncompromising bitterness. A bottle lasts practically forever.
