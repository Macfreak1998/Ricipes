# Green Chartreuse

## Beschreibung
Green Chartreuse is one of the most complex and fascinating liqueurs in the world - an intense, herb-rich spirit with a secret recipe, made by Carthusian monks in France since 1737. The recipe reportedly includes 130 different plants, herbs, and spices, whose exact composition is known to only two monks at a time. The result is a liqueur of extraordinary complexity and power.

At 55% ABV, Green Chartreuse is significantly stronger than most liqueurs - it's more of a spirit with sweetness than a sweet liqueur. The bright green color (natural, from chlorophyll) is unmistakable. The taste is a wild, almost overwhelming symphony of herbs: sweet spices, menthol notes, anise, floral elements, earthy herbs, and a honey-like sweetness that holds everything together. It is simultaneously sweet and bitter, warm and cool, earthy and ethereal.

In cocktails, Green Chartreuse is typically used in small amounts - a half or three-quarter ounce is often enough to add enormous aromatic depth to a drink. The Last Word (equal parts Gin, Green Chartreuse, Maraschino, and Lime Juice) shows perfectly how Chartreuse works: the herbal power balances against the other ingredients and creates something greater than the sum of its parts. Green Chartreuse is also excellent as a digestif, neat or on ice. Yellow Chartreuse is a milder, sweeter variant with 40% ABV.

## Verwendung in Cocktails
Green Chartreuse is essential for Last Word, Bijou, Alaska, and modern creations such as the Chartreuse Swizzle. The intense herbal complexity makes Green Chartreuse one of the most versatile and exciting modifiers in the cocktail world.
