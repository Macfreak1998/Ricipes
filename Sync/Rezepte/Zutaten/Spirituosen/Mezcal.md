# Mezcal

## Beschreibung
Mezcal is the smoky, wild soul of Mexico - an agave spirit with deep tradition and unmistakable character. While tequila is a specific type of mezcal (from blue agave, from Jalisco), mezcal can be made from over 30 different agave varieties, primarily in Oaxaca. The word "mezcal" means "cooked agave" and perfectly describes the core of this spirit.

What distinguishes mezcal from tequila is the production method. The agave hearts (piñas) are traditionally roasted in underground pits over hot stones and wood before being crushed, fermented, and distilled. This roasting gives mezcal its characteristic smoky taste - think campfire, grilled vegetables, and sometimes even a meaty, umami-like quality. Behind this lie the earthy, complex notes of the agave itself.

Mezcal shows an astonishing diversity of flavors, depending on the agave variety used (Espadín is most common, but Tobalá, Madrecuishe, and others offer unique profiles), the region, and the production method. Beyond the smoke, you'll often find fruity notes (citrus, tropical fruits), mineral elements, floral nuances, and a peppery sharpness. Most mezcals are bottled at 40-55% ABV, with some artisanal variants being even stronger. For cocktails, choose a balanced mezcal with present but not overwhelming smoke.

## Verwendung in Cocktails
Mezcal works excellently in variations of classic drinks (Mezcal [[Margarita]], Oaxaca [[Sync/Rezepte/Cocktails/Old Fashioned]]) or as a smoky accent in combination with other spirits. The smoke pairs beautifully with citrus, [[Agave Syrup]], and bitter elements.
