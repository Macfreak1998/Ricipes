# Vodka

## Beschreibung
Vodka is a clear, neutral spirit traditionally distilled from grain or potatoes. The name comes from the Russian word "voda" (water) - a fitting description for this exceptionally pure spirit. What distinguishes vodka from other spirits is the goal of production: maximum purity and neutrality. While gin, whiskey, or rum emphasize their characteristic flavors, vodka strives for tasteful clarity.

This doesn't make vodka boring - quite the opposite. High-quality vodkas show subtle differences in texture and mouthfeel. Some are creamy and soft, others have a clean, crisp character. These nuances arise from the choice of raw materials, the number of distillations, and the filtration methods. Modern vodka production can include up to five or more distillations, often followed by filtration through activated charcoal or even diamond dust.

In cocktails, vodka is the ultimate team player. Its neutrality lets other ingredients shine - perfect for drinks like the Cosmopolitan, Espresso Martini, or Moscow Mule, where vodka provides a clean alcoholic base without overpowering the fruit, coffee, or ginger flavors. The typical alcohol content is 40% ABV (80 proof), with some premium products also at 50% ABV or higher.
