# Beschreibung

Lillet Blanc is a French aromatized wine (more specifically, a quinquina or tonic wine) that has been produced since 1887 in Podensac near Bordeaux. Although often compared or confused with vermouth, Lillet is technically its own category: it's based on Bordeaux wines (85% Sémillon and Sauvignon Blanc, 15% liqueur wine) that are aromatized with fruit liqueurs and cinchona bark, which gives it its characteristically light bitter, quinine-laden character.

The production of Lillet is a multi-stage process: First, the white wines from Bordeaux are infused with macerated fruit peels (mainly sweet oranges from Spain, Morocco, and Haiti, as well as bitter oranges from Haiti). This maceration lasts several months. Then the aromatized wine is combined with a liqueur wine from Bordeaux and aged in oak barrels for 6-12 months before being bottled at 17% ABV. The result is a golden, lightly aromatized wine with intense citrus and floral notes.

The flavor of Lillet Blanc is fresh and fruity, dominated by orange peels, honey, floral notes, and a subtle quinine bitterness on the finish. Compared to vermouth, Lillet is lighter, less herbal, and more fruit-focused. The sweetness is present but balanced, and the texture is less syrupy than sweet vermouth. Lillet has an elegant, aperitif-friendly character that makes it attractive both neat and in cocktails.

Important to know: The original Lillet recipe from 1887 until 1986 was called "Kina Lillet" and was significantly more bitter and quinine-heavy. In 1986, the formula was modernized to be more accessible, resulting in today's Lillet Blanc. Many classic cocktail recipes that call for "Kina Lillet" (such as the Vesper from James Bond) taste different with modern Lillet Blanc than originally intended. Some bartenders therefore use Cocchi Americano as a substitute, which is closer to the old Kina Lillet.

## Verwendung in Cocktails

Lillet Blanc is famous as an ingredient in the Vesper (with [[Gin]], [[Vodka]], and Lillet), although the original Kina Lillet no longer exists. It works excellently as a lighter alternative to vermouth in many classic cocktails - a "Lillet Martini" or "[[Corpse Reviver #2]]" with Lillet instead of [[Dry Vermouth]] is fresher and fruitier. Neat on ice with an orange slice, Lillet is a classic French aperitif. In modern cocktails, bartenders often use it in fruity or citrus-forward drinks, where its orange note complements other ingredients. It also works well in spritz-style drinks with soda or [[Champagne]]. Lillet pairs particularly well with gin - the botanical notes of gin and the fruitiness of Lillet are a natural match.
