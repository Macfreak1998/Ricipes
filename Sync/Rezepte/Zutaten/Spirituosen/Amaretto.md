# Beschreibung

Amaretto is a sweet Italian liqueur known for its characteristic almond flavor. Interestingly, authentic Amaretto is traditionally not made from real almonds but from apricot kernels, which have a very similar but more intense marzipan-like aroma. These kernels contain the same aromatic compounds (benzaldehyde) that also give bitter almonds their typical taste. Some premium Amarettos combine apricot kernels with real almonds for additional complexity.

The most famous brand is Disaronno Originale (formerly Amaretto Disaronno), which has been made according to a secret recipe since 1525 and sets the worldwide standard for Amaretto. Disaronno has approximately 28% ABV and a very sweet, oily body with intense notes of marzipan, vanilla, and a light touch of cherries or peaches. There are also other producers such as Lazzaroni and Luxardo, each offering their own interpretations, often slightly less sweet and with more nut complexity.

The taste of Amaretto is dominated by sweet marzipan, but good Amarettos also show subtle notes of vanilla, brown sugar, and sometimes a touch of spices. The texture is typically syrupy and sticky, which means Amaretto adds weight and body to cocktails, not just taste. The lower alcohol content (compared to spirits) means it functions more as a modifier or sweetener than as a base spirit.

Amaretto gained enormous popularity in the 1970s-80s, especially in drinks such as the Amaretto Sour and as a mix with Cola or coffee. While this era is often associated with overly sweet, simple drinks, the modern cocktail movement has rediscovered Amaretto in more interesting ways, often in smaller amounts as a complexity and texture provider.

## Verwendung in Cocktails

Amaretto is the star of the Amaretto Sour, especially in the modern, improved version with Bourbon and egg white. In the Godfather, it is combined with Scotch for a simple but satisfying spirit-forward drink. Many modern bartenders use Amaretto in quarters or half ounces to add depth and sweetness to drinks such as the Paper Plane or various whiskey cocktails. It also works excellently in coffee drinks - a shot of Amaretto in an Espresso Martini or Irish Coffee adds marzipan complexity. In Tiki drinks, a small amount of Amaretto can work surprisingly well and bring a nutty depth. It's important to dose it carefully, as its sweetness can quickly become overwhelming.
