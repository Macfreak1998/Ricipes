# Sweet Vermouth

## Beschreibung
Sweet Vermouth, also called Rosso or Italian Vermouth, is an aromatized, fortified wine - the sweet, spicy soul of the Manhattan and Negroni. Vermouth is not a liqueur but a fortified wine: wine (typically from Italy), strengthened to about 16-18% ABV with neutral alcohol or brandy, aromatized with dozens of botanicals (herbs, spices, roots, barks) and sweetened with sugar or caramel.

The color of sweet vermouth ranges from amber to deep red, with most Italian vermouths showing a rich, mahogany-like coloring. The taste is complex and multifaceted: think sweet spices (cinnamon, cloves, vanilla), bittersweet herbal notes, sometimes citrus peels, dried fruits, and a pleasant sweetness that holds everything together. The most famous brand is Carpano Antica Formula, but Cocchi, Dolin Rouge, and Punt e Mes (a more bitter style) are also excellent.

What many don't know: vermouth is perishable. After opening, the wine component oxidizes, loses freshness, and develops flat, musty notes. Sweet vermouth keeps well in the refrigerator for about a month - after that, the quality noticeably suffers. In cocktails, sweet vermouth brings a wonderful balance: the sweetness rounds off harsh spirits, the herbs add complexity, and the wine character brings body and mouthfeel. The difference between fresh and oxidized vermouth is dramatic - always use fresh vermouth for best results.
