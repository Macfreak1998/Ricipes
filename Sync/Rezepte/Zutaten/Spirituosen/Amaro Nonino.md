# Beschreibung

Amaro Nonino Quintessentia is a premium amaro from Friuli in northeastern Italy, produced by the Nonino family since 1897. What distinguishes Amaro Nonino from most other amari is its base: instead of neutral alcohol or wine spirits, it uses Grappa, an Italian grape pomace brandy, which gives it a uniquely fruity, delicate character. This Grappa base, combined with a careful selection of botanicals, makes Amaro Nonino one of the more accessible and versatile amari on the market.

Production begins with the Nonino family's own Grappa, which is then infused with a mixture of herbs, roots, and fruits. The exact recipe is secret, but known ingredients are gentian root, rhubarb, tamarind, sweet and bitter oranges, saffron, and herbs from the Friulian Alps. After maceration, the amaro is sweetened with honey and sugar and then blended with E (grape must distillate). The finished amaro has 35% ABV and an amber-orange color.

The taste of Amaro Nonino is relatively light and accessible for an amaro. The bitterness is present but balanced by distinct citrus notes (especially orange), honey sweetness, caramel, and a light grape fruitiness from the Grappa base. There are also spicy notes (saffron, licorice) and a gentle herbal bitterness. Compared to heavier amari such as Fernet or Ramazzotti, Nonino is more elegant and less intense, making it attractive both as a digestif and in cocktails.

Amaro Nonino became particularly popular through the Paper Plane cocktail, which combines it in equal parts with Bourbon, Aperol, and Lemon Juice. This drink has massively increased the fame of Amaro Nonino outside of Italy and shown how well it can function in modern, balanced cocktails.

## Verwendung in Cocktails

Amaro Nonino is the star of the Paper Plane, where its orange-honey-bitter balance harmonizes perfectly with Bourbon and Aperol. It also works excellently as a digestif component in spirit-forward drinks - half or three-quarters of an ounce in an Old Fashioned or Manhattan adds complexity and a subtle bitterness. In Negroni variations, Amaro Nonino can partially or completely replace Campari for a less bitter, fruitier character. Many modern bartenders use it in sour-style drinks, where its orange note and sweetness harmonize well with citrus. It is also excellent neat on ice or as a component in a Spritz. It works particularly well with Whiskey (Bourbon or Rye), but also shows interesting facets with Rum or Tequila.
