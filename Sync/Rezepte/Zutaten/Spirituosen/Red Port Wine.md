# Red Port Wine

## Beschreibung

Red Port Wine is one of the great fortified wines of the world - rich, sweet, complex and with centuries of tradition. Coming from Portugal's Douro Valley, Port is made by adding brandy during fermentation, which stops fermentation and leaves natural sugar in the wine. The result: sweet, powerful and incredibly versatile.

Port comes in many styles, but for cocktails two are particularly relevant: **Ruby Port** (young, fruity, bright red) and **Tawny Port** (barrel-aged, nutty, amber-colored). Ruby is bolder and fruitier, Tawny softer and more complex with oxidative notes.

**Taste profile:** Ruby Port tastes of dark berries (blackberry, black cherry), plum, chocolate and spicy notes. Tawny Port develops flavors of roasted nuts, caramel, dried fruits and cinnamon through extended barrel aging. Both are noticeably sweet, but balanced by alcohol and tannins. Alcohol content: 19-22% ABV.

**Styles overview:**
- **Ruby Port** - Young, fruity, intense red
- **Tawny Port** - Barrel-aged, nutty, amber
- **Vintage Port** - Best vintages, long bottle aging (too expensive for cocktails)
- **LBV (Late Bottled Vintage)** - Compromise between Ruby and Vintage

## Verwendung in Cocktails

Port brings sweetness, fruitiness and complexity to cocktails without the artificial sweetness of liqueurs. It works brilliantly in autumn and winter drinks and harmonizes wonderfully with dark spirits.

Popular Cocktails:
- [[Port Cobbler]] - Port, sugar, fruits over crushed ice
- [[Coffee Cocktail]] - Port, Brandy, egg yolk, sugar (no coffee!)
- [[Harvard]] - Brandy, Sweet Vermouth, Orange Bitters, Port float
- [[Porto Flip]] - Port, Brandy, egg yolk, sugar
- [[Bourbon Renewal]] - Bourbon, Crème de Cassis, lemon juice, Port float

**Mixology Tips:** Port is fantastic as a "float" - a thin layer on top of a drink that impresses visually and aromatically dominates the first sip. For most cocktails, an affordable to mid-range Ruby Port is absolutely sufficient - premium Vintage Port is wasted in drinks. Tawny Port works particularly well in combination with aged spirits like Cognac or Bourbon, where its nutty notes harmonize. Port can also serve as a substitute for Sweet Vermouth, but brings more fruitiness and less herbal complexity. Once opened, Port lasts longer than vermouth (2-3 months refrigerated), but considerably shorter than unfortified wines.
