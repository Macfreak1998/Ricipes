Drambuie is a Scottish whisky liqueur that combines Scotch Whisky with heather honey, herbs, and spices. The name comes from the Gaelic "an dram buidheach," meaning "the drink that satisfies." Legend has it that the recipe was given by Bonnie Prince Charlie to the Clan MacKinnon in 1746 after his defeat at Culloden, as thanks for their loyalty. Whether this story is true or not, Drambuie was commercially introduced in 1910 and has since been one of the most famous whisky liqueurs in the world.

The base of Drambuie is a blend of aged Scotch whiskies (both malts and grain whiskies), which are then flavored with heather honey, herbs, and spices. The exact recipe is secret, but you can clearly taste the honey, Scotch character, and subtle spice notes such as anise, saffron, and herbs. At 40% ABV, Drambuie has more alcoholic weight than many other liqueurs, making it more versatile in cocktails - it's not just a sweetener but also contributes spirit character.

The taste of Drambuie is a harmonious balance between the malty, slightly smoky character of Scotch and the rich sweetness of heather honey. The herbal and spice notes are subtle, not dominant, and add complexity without overwhelming. The texture is syrupy but not too thick, and the finish shows both honey sweetness and whisky warmth. Compared to pure Scotch, Drambuie is naturally sweeter and more accessible, but it retains enough whisky character to function in spirit-forward drinks.

There is also Drambuie 15, a premium version that uses exclusively 15-year-old malts and shows a richer, more complex character. For most cocktails, however, standard Drambuie is completely sufficient and often even better suited, as its more balanced sweetness harmonizes better with other ingredients.

## Verwendung in Cocktails

Drambuie is the star of the Rusty Nail, a simple but elegant drink of Scotch and Drambuie on ice. This combination shows perfectly how Drambuie can sweeten and round out Scotch without masking its character. In the Penicillin, Drambuie is sometimes used as an alternative to honey-ginger syrup, which gives the drink more complexity. Many modern bartenders use Drambuie in small amounts as a modifier in whisky cocktails, where it adds honey sweetness and herbal complexity. It also works well in bourbon-based drinks, although that's unorthodox - the honey note harmonizes beautifully with the caramel flavors of bourbon. In a Blood & Sand (classically with Scotch, Cherry Heering, Sweet Vermouth, Orange Juice), a small amount of Drambuie can bring additional depth.
