# White Rum

## Beschreibung
White Rum, also called Light Rum or Silver Rum, is the clear, light variant of rum - distilled from sugarcane molasses or fresh sugarcane juice and either unaged or briefly aged and then filtered to remove color. This category forms the backbone of countless tropical cocktails, from Mojitos to Piña Coladas.

White Rum is typically continuously distilled (column still), which produces a lighter, purer spirit with fewer congeners than pot-still rums. The result is a clean, subtle rum with gentle sugarcane notes, sometimes a hint of vanilla or coconut, and a slight sweetness. Unlike vodka, good white rum definitely has character - it shouldn't be completely neutral, but rather show the gentle sweetness and freshness of sugarcane.

The various Caribbean islands produce white rums with different profiles. Puerto Rican rums (like Bacardi) tend to be very light and clean. Cuban styles (made in the Cuban tradition) are also elegant and restrained. Dominican and Barbados rums often show more body and character. The alcohol content is normally 40% ABV (80 proof), with some "overproof" variants being significantly stronger and specifically used for tiki drinks.
