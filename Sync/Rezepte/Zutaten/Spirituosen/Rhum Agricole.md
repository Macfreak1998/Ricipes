# Beschreibung

Rhum Agricole is a special rum category from the French Caribbean islands, especially from Martinique, that differs fundamentally from most other rums. While most rums are distilled from molasses, Rhum Agricole is made directly from fresh sugarcane juice. This production method gives it a completely different taste profile, characterized by grassy, vegetal, and earthy notes.

Production follows strict AOC guidelines in Martinique, similar to Cognac or Champagne. The fresh sugarcane juice is fermented relatively quickly after harvest and then distilled in column stills. The result is a rum with distinct terroir character that reflects the flavors of the sugarcane itself rather than the darker molasses notes. You often find notes of fresh grass, olives, white pepper, and sometimes even floral accents.

Rhum Agricole is available in various age levels: Rhum Agricole Blanc (unaged, about 50% ABV), Élevé Sous Bois (briefly aged in stainless steel barrels or neutral wood), and Vieux (aged in oak barrels). White Rhum Agricole is particularly popular in Tiki drinks and classic Caribbean cocktails, where its grassy, lively character offers a refreshing alternative to standard rums.

In cocktails, Rhum Agricole brings special complexity and an unmistakable character. It is the soul of Ti' Punch, the national drink of Martinique, and works excellently in Daiquiris and other rum-forward drinks. Its higher proof and pronounced aroma mean it doesn't get lost even in mixed drinks.

## Verwendung in Cocktails

Rhum Agricole is essential for authentic Caribbean cocktails and modern Tiki drinks. The Ti' Punch (Rhum, Lime, Raw Sugar) is the simplest and perhaps best way to judge the quality of a Rhum Agricole. In Daiquiris, it provides a grassy, complex alternative to the Cuban style. Many modern bartenders also use Rhum Agricole in split-base cocktails, where it is combined with other spirits to add depth and character. White Rhum Agricole works particularly well in refreshing, citrus-heavy drinks, while aged Rhum Vieux is suited for spirit-forward creations.
