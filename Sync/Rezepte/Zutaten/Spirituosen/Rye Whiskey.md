# Rye Whiskey

## Beschreibung
Rye Whiskey is the spicy, powerful cousin of bourbon - an American whiskey that must contain at least 51% rye in its mash. While bourbon gets its sweetness from corn, rye brings sharpness, spice, and a dry, peppery quality. This makes rye a fantastic choice for cocktails that need a bit more backbone and character.

Like bourbon, rye whiskey must age in new, charred oak barrels and is distilled at no more than 160 proof (80% ABV). The aging develops similar vanilla and caramel notes as in bourbon, but the rye profile remains dominant. The result is a whiskey with vibrant spice notes - think black pepper, cloves, anise, and sometimes a hint of mint or herbs. Most ryes also have a pleasant dryness that refreshes the palate rather than overwhelming it.

Historically, rye was the standard whiskey for American cocktails in the 19th and early 20th centuries. The classic Manhattan was originally made with rye, not bourbon. After Prohibition, rye lost popularity, but has experienced an impressive renaissance since the 2000s. The typical alcohol content ranges from 40-50% ABV (80-100 proof), with some powerful variants at 100 proof or higher.
