# Blanc Vermouth

## Beschreibung

Blanc Vermouth (also called Bianco Vermouth) is a category of aromatized wine that sits between dry and sweet vermouth – it has the sweetness of Sweet Vermouth, but the lighter color and more delicate flavors of Dry Vermouth. "Blanc" refers to its pale, straw-yellow to clear color, in contrast to the dark red or amber Sweet Vermouth. This style originally comes from France, especially the Chambéry region, but is now also produced in Italy and other countries.

The production of Blanc Vermouth begins with a neutral white wine base, which is then aromatized with a botanical blend of herbs, roots, flowers, and spices. Like all vermouths, wormwood (Artemisia) is a key ingredient, but Blanc Vermouth often emphasizes floral and vanilla notes more than the bitter or spicy notes of other vermouth styles. The wine is sweetened with sugar (similar to Sweet Vermouth) and then often fortified with neutral alcohol to about 16-18% ABV.

The taste of Blanc Vermouth is characterized by floral notes (often elderflower, chamomile, or orange blossom), vanilla, light herbs, and a gentle sweetness that is less intense than red Sweet Vermouth. Well-known brands include Dolin Blanc (from Chambéry, very floral and delicate), Martini Bianco (sweeter and vanilla-forward), and Lillet Blanc (although Lillet is technically a quinquina, not a vermouth, it's often used similarly). The character is lighter and more accessible than other vermouths, making it attractive both neat on ice and in cocktails.

Blanc Vermouth had great popularity in the 1980s-90s, especially in Europe, where Martini Bianco was drunk with tonic or Sprite. In the craft cocktail era it was somewhat overlooked, but modern bartenders are rediscovering it as a versatile tool that brings sweetness and complexity without the heavy, dark notes of red vermouth.

## Verwendung in Cocktails

Blanc Vermouth works excellently in variations of classic cocktails, where you want the structure of Sweet Vermouth but prefer a lighter color and more delicate flavors. In a "Blanc Negroni" (with Gin, Blanc Vermouth, and Suze instead of Campari) it shows its floral side. A "Blonde Vermouth Cocktail" with Gin and Blanc Vermouth instead of Dry is richer and more interesting. It also works well in highballs – Blanc Vermouth with tonic and a spritz of citrus is a refreshing aperitif. Many modern bartenders use Blanc Vermouth in fruity or floral cocktails, where its gentle character complements rather than dominates the other ingredients. It harmonizes particularly well with lighter spirits like Gin or Vodka.
