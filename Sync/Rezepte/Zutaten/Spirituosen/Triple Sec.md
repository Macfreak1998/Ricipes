# Triple Sec

## Beschreibung
Triple Sec is a clear orange liqueur - sweet, aromatic, and indispensable for countless classic cocktails. The name "Triple Sec" means "triple dry," although modern Triple Secs are rather sweet. The designation originally refers to a triple distillation. Triple Sec is made from dried peels of bitter and sweet oranges, which are macerated in neutral alcohol and then distilled.

The quality of Triple Sec varies enormously. Cheap variants are often simply flavored, sweetened alcohol without real distillation - these taste artificial and one-dimensional. High-quality Triple Secs like Cointreau show natural orange flavors, a balance between sweetness and bitter peel notes, and a clean, elegant quality. The alcohol content typically ranges from 15-40% ABV, with premium products often at 40% ABV (like Cointreau).

In cocktails, Triple Sec plays multiple roles simultaneously: it brings sweetness (requiring less simple syrup), adds natural orange flavors, and enhances citrus aromas through its own citrus oils. A Margarita or Sidecar without good Triple Sec/Cointreau feels flat and one-dimensional. The orange oils add body, roundness, and aromatic complexity. For best results in classic cocktails, invest in a high-quality Triple Sec like Cointreau, Pierre Ferrand Dry Curaçao, or Grand Marnier (a cognac-based orange liqueur).
