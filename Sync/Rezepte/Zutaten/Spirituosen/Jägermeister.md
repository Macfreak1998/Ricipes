# Jägermeister

## Beschreibung

Jägermeister is a German herbal liqueur developed in 1934 by Curt Mast in Wolfenbüttel. The name literally means "master hunter" and refers to the German hunting tradition - the logo shows a stag with a glowing cross between its antlers. The liqueur is made from 56 different herbs, flowers, roots and fruits and has an alcohol content of 35%. After maceration, the product is aged for at least one year in oak barrels, which contributes to its complexity.

The taste profile is intensely herbal and bittersweet, with distinct notes of anise, licorice, citrus peel and a whole palette of spices. Unlike many other herbal liqueurs, Jägermeister is noticeably sweeter, partly achieved through the addition of caramel and sugar. This sweetness makes it more accessible than, for example, Fernet Branca, but it still presents a complex bitterness that comes from herbs such as wormwood and gentian.

The production follows a closely guarded recipe, in which the 56 botanicals are macerated in separate batches and then mixed into a base extract. This is blended with neutral alcohol, water, sugar and caramel and then aged for one year in German oak barrels. Barrel aging is unusual for herbal liqueurs and gives Jägermeister a certain roundness and smoothness.

In Germany, Jägermeister is traditionally served as an ice-cold digestif after meals, and many Germans swear it aids digestion. Internationally, it became particularly popular as a party shot in the 2000s, which somewhat damaged its image. In the craft cocktail scene, however, Jägermeister is experiencing a renaissance - modern bartenders use it in small amounts (0.25 to 0.75 oz) to bring depth, spice and a bittersweet complexity to cocktails. It works surprisingly well in combination with dark spirits, citrus fruits and ginger.

## Verwendung in Cocktails
