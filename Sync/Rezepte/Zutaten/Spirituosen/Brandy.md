# Brandy

## Beschreibung
The most famous distillates from wine are the renowned brandies of France, [[Cognac]] and [[Armagnac]]. But Spain, Italy, Portugal, Greece, Germany, the United States, and South America also produce excellent brandies. As a rule, the various brandy types in individual countries are 80° proof (40% alcohol); the details are controlled by national regulations.

**Important**: [[Marc]] and [[Grappa]] are, in contrast to other brandies, not distilled from wine but from the skins and seeds of pressed grapes.

## Regionale Brandy-Typen

### Spanischer Brandy
Brandy has been produced in Spain for over a hundred years. Although brandy is made in various locations, Spaniards are among the largest brandy consumers in the world. Brandies vary considerably in taste, color, and quality. Most are produced by the alcoholic distilleries in Jerez de la Frontera. However, the wines come from the La Mancha region south of Madrid - it is no wonder that they frequently bear the brandy term "solera method" (see Sherry).

**Altersbezeichnungen**:
- **Brandy de Jerez Solera** (the oldest brandies): At least 1 year in barrel
- **Brandy de Jerez Solera Reserva**: At least 3 years aged
- **Brandy de Jerez Solera Gran Reserva**: 10+ years

### Deutscher Brandy
The Treaty of Versailles prohibited the use of the term *Cognac* for German brandies. Therefore, they had to use the generic term *Weinbrand* instead, coined by Hugo Asbach, who enforced this definition.

German brandies can be made from wines of all countries and producers. Famous European Cognac or Gascony distillates are used for German distillates or unfermented brandies from famous brandy-producing regions such as Charente or Gascony.

The brandy must be aged in oak barrels for at least 6 months; brandies that have been aged longer than twelve months can bear the designation "Old Brandy Wine," but under the term *Weinbrand*.

### U.S. Brandy
Two-thirds of the brandy consumed in the United States is produced in this country, and virtually all of it comes from California. Brandy from this state is mainly made from wines produced from table or raisin grapes, and is clean, light, and somewhat fruity. In recent years, small artisan producers have succeeded in using Cognac-style pot stills to produce tiny amounts of very high quality, particularly aromatic brandy.

### Italienischer Brandy
Generally 80° proof (40% alcohol). Buton in Bologna produces exceptional brandies, among others: Baron Vecchia Romagna, Gran Ducale, and Nero Etichetta Oro.

### Portugiesischer Brandy
The Portuguese term for brandy is *aguardente*. This brandy is aged in old port wine barrels because the majority of Portuguese brandy producers are port wine makers. Ribeiro & Ferreiro are, for example, Magellan producers. Stock Ardente (smooth brandy) is 84° proof; from Stiacco Turino; Stock Ardente (strong brandy) 84° proof.

### Griechischer Brandy
Metaxa is the most famous Greek brandy. It is distilled from grape must and flavored with wine and muscatel wines. It is 80° proof (40% alcohol) and is available in various quality grades. The number of stars indicates the quality; most are not only clearly distinguishable but have high quality:
- Metaxa ★★★★★ (5 stars)
- Golden Amphora (7 stars)
- Grand Olympian Reserve
- Centenary

### Südamerikanischer Brandy - Pisco
Pisco, the national drink of Chile, is rich in tradition. The base wine, which is mainly made from Muscat grapes, grows north of Santiago de Chile in precisely defined official regions. An aging period in oak or clay vessels is followed by the distillation process.

The most popular in Chile - with annual sales of 23 million bottles - is Pisco Control in La Serena.

Other South American countries that produce brandy are Argentina, Bolivia, and Peru.

**Pisco Sour** is the most famous Pisco bar drink.

### Marc and Grappa
Brandy does not have to be distilled from wine; it can also be distilled from the residues of grapes that were pressed for winemaking. Marc from France and Grappa from Italy are such "pomace brandies," formerly known as *bagos* or *pigjé-out* brandy, today these designations have gained noble recognition.

## Verwendung in Cocktails
Brandy is used in many classic cocktails, including Sidecar, Brandy Alexander, Metropolitan, Brandy Crusta, and many more.
