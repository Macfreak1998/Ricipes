# Angostura Bitters

## Beschreibung
Angostura Bitters are the most famous and indispensable bitters in the cocktail world - a concentrated, high-alcohol aromatic extract from Trinidad with a secret recipe since 1824. Bitters are not a spirit for drinking, but a concentrated seasoning for cocktails - think of them as the salt and pepper of the bar world. A few dashes are enough to add depth, complexity, and balance to a drink.

At 44.7% ABV, Angostura Bitters are strongly alcoholic, but you use only drops, not ounces. The recipe is secret, but the taste profile is unmistakable: intensive spice notes (cinnamon, cloves, cardamom), bittersweet herbs, a slightly medicinal quality, roots, and a general "aromatic" characteristic that's hard to describe but easy to recognize. The iconic oversized label (originally a mistake that became tradition) makes Angostura unmistakable.

In cocktails, bitters play multiple roles: they add complexity, connect different taste components, enhance aromatic qualities of other ingredients, and bring balance. An Old Fashioned without Angostura is flat and one-dimensional - the bitters give the drink backbone and depth. The standard amount is 2-3 dashes, but some drinks (like the Trinidad Sour) use Angostura as the main ingredient. Besides Angostura, there are many other bitters styles: Orange Bitters, Peychaud's, Chocolate, etc. - each brings its own personality.
