# Allspice Dram

## Beschreibung

Allspice Dram, also known as Pimento Dram, is a Caribbean spice liqueur made from allspice berries (pimento). These intensely aromatic berries, which combine notes of cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves, are traditionally macerated in rum and then sweetened with sugar. The term "dram" is historical and refers to a small amount of a strong drink.

The liqueur typically has about 22-30% alcohol and presents a complex aroma profile that is warm, spicy and slightly sweet. The allspice berry itself originates from Jamaica and the West Indies, where it has played an important role in the local rum culture for centuries. St. Elizabeth is the best-known commercial brand, but many bartenders also make their own version.

In mixology, Allspice Dram is an indispensable component of many Tiki cocktails and classic Caribbean drinks. It's almost always used in small amounts - typically only 0.25 to 0.5 oz - as its intense spice profile can be dominant. The liqueur brings depth and warmth to rum-based cocktails and is particularly effective in winter or autumn drinks.

The most common uses are Tiki classics like the Lion's Tail, where it complements bourbon, or the Ancient Mariner. Allspice Dram works excellently in combination with dark spirits - especially Rum, Bourbon and Rye Whiskey - and harmonizes well with citrus fruits, ginger and other spices. For home use, a bottle keeps practically indefinitely, as the high alcohol and sugar content acts as a natural preservative.
