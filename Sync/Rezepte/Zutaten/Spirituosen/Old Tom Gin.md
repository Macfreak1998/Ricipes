# Old Tom Gin

## Beschreibung

Old Tom Gin is the missing link between modern London Dry Gin and genever-like Dutch Gin - and it's absolutely crucial if you want to authentically recreate classic cocktails from the 19th century.

The name likely comes from the "Old Tom" cat signs at English pubs in the 18th century, where illicit gin was sold. Old Tom is slightly sweetened, which distinguishes it from London Dry, but it's still clearly a gin with distinct juniper notes. This sweetness made it popular at a time when spirits were often rougher and the sweetness helped smooth harsh edges.

**Taste profile:** Juniper is in the foreground, but accompanied by a gentle sweetness and softer botanicals. Depending on the brand, the sweetness can be subtle (Hayman's) or more pronounced (Ransom). The texture is rounder and softer than London Dry, with 40-47% ABV. Some versions are sweetened with sugar, others with licorice or other botanicals.

**Production:** Old Tom is made similarly to London Dry, but with the addition of sugar or sweetening botanicals either during or after distillation. Some premium versions (like Ransom) are even barrel-aged, which brings additional complexity.

## Verwendung in Cocktails

Old Tom was the standard gin in the golden age of cocktails (1850-1900) and is essential for historically correct recipes. Its slightly sweet character also makes it interesting in modern drinks, where it creates balance without letting sweetness dominate.

Classic Cocktails:
- [[Tom Collins]] - Originally made with Old Tom, not London Dry
- [[Martinez]] - The predecessor to the Martini calls for Old Tom
- [[Ramos Gin Fizz]] - The sweetness harmonizes perfectly with cream and egg white
- [[Aviation]] - Some prefer Old Tom for more balance
- [[Improved Gin Cocktail]] - A Victorian classic

**Mixology Tips:** Old Tom works particularly well wherever London Dry would be too sharp or dry. In drinks with acidic components (citrus) or bitter elements (Chartreuse, Absinthe) it creates wonderful balance. It's also excellent in Fizzes and Flips, where its sweetness harmonizes with cream or egg. If a recipe simply calls for "Gin" and dates from before 1900, Old Tom was probably meant.
