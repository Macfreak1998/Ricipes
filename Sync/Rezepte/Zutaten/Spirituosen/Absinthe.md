# Beschreibung

Absinthe is a high-proof, anise-based spirit known for its distinctive green color (often called "La Fée Verte" or "The Green Fairy"), complex herbal character, and controversial history. The main ingredients are wormwood (Artemisia absinthium), green anise, and fennel, complemented by a variety of other botanicals such as melissa, hyssop, angelica root, and coriander. Absinthe was developed in late 18th century Switzerland and became particularly popular in France during the 19th century, before being banned in 1915 (the ban was only lifted in the 2000s).

The production of authentic absinthe is a two-stage process. First, the main botanicals (wormwood, anise, fennel) are macerated in neutral alcohol and then distilled. After distillation, the clear spirit is macerated again with additional herbs (often melissa, hyssop, and other "green" botanicals), which gives absinthe its characteristic green color and additional layers of aroma. This process is called "coloration." The finished absinthe typically has 55-75% ABV - this high strength is necessary to keep the essential oils from the botanicals in solution.

The flavor of absinthe is intense and herb-forward. Anise is usually the most prominent note, followed by wormwood bitterness, fennel, and depending on the recipe, various other herbs. Good absinthe is complex and balanced, not just "licorice-like." The wormwood note should be present as a subtle bitterness and herbaceousness, not overwhelming. Cheap or poorly made absinthes can taste too sweet, too anise-heavy, or artificial.

Absinthe is traditionally not drunk neat, but diluted: Cold water is slowly poured over a sugar cube (on a special spoon placed over the glass), which makes the absinthe turn milky-cloudy (the "louche") as the essential oils precipitate out. This dilution opens up the flavors and makes the spirit drinkable. The ratio is typically 1 part absinthe to 3-5 parts water.

## Verwendung in Cocktails

In cocktails, absinthe is almost always used in very small amounts - often just as a "rinse" (a few drops that coat the glass and are then poured out) or a barspoon. In a Sazerac, an absinthe rinse is essential and gives the drink its characteristic anise aroma. The [[Corpse Reviver #2]] uses a dash of absinthe for herbal complexity. In a "Death in the Afternoon" (absinthe with Champagne), it shows its full power. Many classic cocktails from the 19th century use a dash of absinthe as a flavor enhancer. Modern bartenders often use it as a "secret ingredient" - a few drops can give a drink a mysterious, hard-to-identify depth. Important: With absinthe, "less is more" - too much can quickly overwhelm a drink.
