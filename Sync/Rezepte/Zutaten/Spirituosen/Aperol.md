# Aperol

## Beschreibung
Aperol is the more accessible, sweeter cousin of Campari - an Italian aperitif liqueur with bright orange color and a friendlier bitter profile. Created in Padua in 1919, Aperol is based on a blend of oranges (sweet and bitter), rhubarb, gentian root, and various herbs. At only 11% ABV, Aperol is also significantly lighter than Campari, making it perfect for fizzy long drinks.

The taste of Aperol is pleasantly balanced: light bitterness from gentian and bitter oranges, sweet orange notes, a hint of rhubarb and herbs, all in perfect harmony. Compared to Campari, Aperol is significantly sweeter, less intensely bitter, and shows more fruity characteristics. This makes Aperol the perfect introduction to the world of Italian bitter liqueurs - accessible enough for beginners, but complex enough to remain interesting.

The low alcohol strength (11% ABV) means that Aperol is mainly used in longer drinks, where it's mixed with Prosecco or soda. The famous Aperol Spritz has made the liqueur popular worldwide and perfectly demonstrates how Aperol works: the light bitterness refreshes, the fruit notes bring vibrancy, and the sweetness makes the drink accessible. Aperol also works excellently in creative cocktails as a less dominant alternative to Campari.
