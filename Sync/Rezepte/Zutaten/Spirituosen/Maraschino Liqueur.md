# Maraschino Liqueur

## Beschreibung
Maraschino Liqueur is a clear, dry cherry liqueur from Croatia - far removed from the bright red, overly sweet cherries you know from cocktail glasses. Authentic maraschino is made from Marasca cherries, a sour cherry variety from Dalmatia. The special feature: the cherries are fermented complete with pits, stems, and skins, then distilled and aged. The result is a complex liqueur with subtle cherry notes, floral flavors, and a slightly bitter almond nuance from the cherry pits.

Luxardo Maraschino is the most famous and widely distributed brand - a product with over 200 years of history. At 32% ABV, maraschino is more powerful than many liqueurs. The taste is elegant and complex: think cherry blossoms, marzipan, a hint of rosewater, cherries in the background, and a gentle, unobtrusive sweetness. The texture is oily and smooth, giving cocktails a wonderful roundness.

In classic cocktails, maraschino often plays a subtle, almost invisible role - a quarter ounce is enough to add enormous depth to a drink. In the Aviation (Gin, Maraschino, Crème de Violette, Lemon Juice), maraschino is essential. In the Hemingway Daiquiri, it balances against the grapefruit. The floral, almond-like notes of maraschino harmonize wonderfully with gin, light rums, and citrus fruits. Use maraschino sparingly - too much can be overwhelming, but the right amount transforms cocktails.
