# Grappa

## Beschreibung
Grappa is an Italian "pomace brandy" that is distilled not from wine but from the skins and seeds (pomace) of pressed grapes. Grappa has a long tradition of production in Italy. Clear, fiery, pungent spirit and a well-aged wine - more than just a raw, rustic liqueur.

In recent years, many wine producers have begun bottling Grappa in barrels and tasting different grape varieties. Some of the individual vineyards and even specific grape varieties of fashionable Grappas are advertised with a special taste. Most Grappas are not aged. The best Grappas age for a few to four years in wooden barrels. The type of wood used influences the bouquet and color - dark wood adds a deeper nuance; oak gives dryness, etc.

## Herstellung
Grappa is distilled from the residues of grapes that were pressed for winemaking. These "pomace" (skins, seeds, and stems) are distilled to produce Grappa.
