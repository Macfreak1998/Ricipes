# Fernet-Branca

## Beschreibung

Fernet-Branca is the most intense and polarizing of the classic Italian amari – you either love it or hate it, rarely is there anything in between. Produced since 1845 by the Branca family in Milan, Fernet-Branca is known for its extremely bitter, menthol-laden character and its alleged medicinal properties (originally marketed as a digestive bitter). The recipe is a closely guarded secret, but it's known to contain over 27 different herbs, roots, and spices from five continents.

The production of Fernet-Branca is complex and time-consuming. The botanicals – including myrrh, rhubarb, chamomile, cardamom, aloe, saffron, and especially mint – are macerated in alcohol, then distilled or extracted, depending on the ingredient. The various extracts are combined, mixed with grape-based alcohol and a minimal amount of sugar, and then aged in Slovenian oak barrels for at least one year. The finished Fernet has 39% ABV and an almost black color.

The taste of Fernet-Branca is a challenge: intense bitterness dominates, followed by strong menthol and mint notes that feel almost medicinal. You'll also find notes of licorice, saffron, herbs, and a slight heat. The sweetness is minimal – Fernet is one of the driest amari on the market. The texture is oily and thick, and the finish is long, bitter, and cooling. For the uninitiated, Fernet can be overwhelming, but fans appreciate precisely this uncompromising intensity.

Fernet-Branca has developed cult status among bartenders and in certain regions – in San Francisco, the "Bartender's Handshake" (a shot of Fernet) is considered a sign of belonging to bar culture, and in Argentina, Fernet mixed with Cola is drunk as a national beverage. This popularity among bartenders has led to Fernet appearing in many modern cocktails, often in small amounts as an intense bitter modifier.

## Verwendung in Cocktails

Fernet-Branca is often used in very small amounts – a barspoon or quarter-ounce can give a cocktail intense bitter complexity. The [[Toronto]] (Rye, Fernet, simple syrup, Angostura bitters) is a classic Fernet cocktail that puts its intensity front and center. In modern cocktails, bartenders often use Fernet as a "rinse" (coating the shaker or glass with it) for a menthol aroma without overwhelming bitterness. The [[Hanky Panky]] (Gin, Sweet Vermouth, Fernet) shows how a dash of Fernet can add depth to a classic drink. In Argentina, "Fernet con Cola" (Fernet with Cola in a 1:3 ratio) is extremely popular. Neat as a digestif after a heavy meal is traditional – the bitterness is said to aid digestion.
