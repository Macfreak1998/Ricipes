# Gin

## Beschreibung
Gin is a grain-based spirit with an adventurous history. Quality gin, as we know it today, was first produced at the beginning of this century. The history of gin is full of ups and downs, and the bad reputation it has suffered was often rooted in particular times and places.

## Herstellung
Gin began with a Dutch professor of medicine, Franciscus de la Boë, who practiced as a physician in the 16th century. The clear alcohol we know today as gin was called "Genever," mainly because of its strong juniper note. Later it was called "Geneva" and then "Genever."

Dutch Genever became popular in England in the 17th century when William III of Orange ascended the British throne (1689). He encouraged grain imports, especially from abroad. Over time, his subjects were allowed to distill Genever, which he had brought from his homeland. The British called it Gin.

British distilleries soon began producing gin in their own stills. At the beginning of the 18th century, drinks similar to gin led to unemployment, poverty, and despair. In 1830, Aeneas Coffey introduced his continuous still, which produced a purer alcohol that could be redistilled with herbs and spices. This created the lighter, purer alcohol that forms the basis of the unsweetened, subtly aromatic gin known as **London Dry Gin**.

### Dutch Gin (Genever)
Holland's national spirit is a full-bodied gin type distilled from a mixture of grains (⅓ barley, ⅓ rye, ⅓ corn). It is available in two main types: *Oude* (old) and *Jonge* (young).

The flavor of Genever comes from the high proportion of malted barley used as the base for distillation. The base material is produced by fermenting a fine mash containing aromatic ingredients such as juniper berries, anise, caraway, coriander, etc. This malt wine plays roughly the same role as malt whisky in a blended Scotch. It is the flavor agent and is mixed with grain alcohol. *Oude Genever* must contain at least 5% *moutwijn*; in quality brands, the percentage is considerably higher.

### Weitere Gin-Varianten
- **Sloe Gin**: Mit Schlehen (Schwarzdorn-Pflaume) gemischt

- **Apple Gin**: Mit Apfel gemischt
- **Lemon Gin**: Mit Zitrone and/or Zitronen-Schalen-Extrakt gemischt
- **Orange Gin**: Mit Bitter-Orange gemischt

**Note**: Gin compounds are not very popular. In a gin compound, the gin absorbs the color and aroma of the ingredient with which it is mixed.
