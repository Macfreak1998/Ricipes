# Beschreibung

Pernod is a French anise liqueur originally developed as an absinthe substitute after absinthe was banned in France in 1915. The Pernod Fils brand was one of the largest absinthe producers before the ban, and when absinthe became illegal, the company reformulated their product without wormwood (the then-banned ingredient) and created "Pernod Anise." Today there is both Pernod Anise (the absinthe substitute) and modern Pernod Absinthe (since absinthe is legal again), but in most bars and recipes, "Pernod" refers to the anise liqueur.

Pernod Anise is distilled from star anise, along with other botanicals such as fennel, coriander, and various Mediterranean herbs. Unlike authentic absinthe, it contains no wormwood and typically has 40-45% ABV. The spirit is clear in the bottle but turns milky-cloudy (louche) when water is added, similar to absinthe. This louche comes from the essential oils in the anise, which precipitate out at lower alcohol content.

The flavor of Pernod is strongly anise-forward, with notes of licorice, fennel, and subtle herbs. Compared to absinthe, Pernod is simpler and less complex - it lacks the wormwood bitterness and the multi-layered herbal complexity. Pernod is sweeter and more accessible than absinthe, making it a popular aperitif in France, typically diluted with cold water (1:5 ratio) and sometimes sweetened with syrup.

Other similar anise liqueurs include Ricard (a competing French brand that is slightly sweeter), Pastis (a general term for French anise liqueurs), and Greek Ouzo or Turkish Raki (both also anise liqueurs, but with regional character). In cocktails, these products can often be used interchangeably, although there are subtle flavor differences.

## Verwendung in Cocktails

Pernod is often used as an absinthe substitute in classic cocktails, especially in recipes from the Prohibition era when real absinthe was unavailable. In a [[Sazerac]], Pernod can replace the absinthe rinse, though the result is somewhat less complex. The "Monkey Gland" (Gin, Orange Juice, [[Grenadine]], Pernod) is a classic cocktail that calls for Pernod. In modern drinks, bartenders often use Pernod in small amounts for anise flavor - a barspoon or a few dashes can be enough. It works particularly well in fruity or citrus-heavy drinks, where the anise note provides an interesting counterpoint. Neat and diluted with water, Pernod is a traditional French aperitif, especially in summer.
