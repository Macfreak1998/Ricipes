# Jamaican Rum

## Beschreibung
Jamaican Rum is the funky, aromatic powerhouse of the rum world - a highly characteristic spirit with intense fruit esters and an unmistakable profile. What makes Jamaican rum special is the traditional production method: long fermentation (often with "dunder" - residues from previous distillations), pot still distillation, and the resulting high concentration of esters. These chemical compounds create intense, almost exaggerated fruit aromas.

The flavor of Jamaican rum is not for the faint-hearted. Think overripe tropical fruits (banana, pineapple, mango), fermented notes, sometimes even cheesy or funky qualities (hence the term "hogo" - high ester or "high game"), paired with spices, molasses, and often a hint of petroleum or solvent. This sounds strange, but in practice results in an incredibly vibrant, aromatic rum with enormous personality.

Brands such as [[Smith & Cross Jamaican Rum]], Appleton Estate, and Hampden show different intensity levels. Smith & Cross is navy strength (57% ABV) and extremely ester-rich - perfect for tiki drinks where a small proportion brings enormous aromatic depth. Appleton offers more accessible but still characteristic profiles. High-ester rums are often "split" with lighter rums to create balance in cocktails. Neat, intensive Jamaican rums are a challenge, but in the right amount they transform cocktails.

## Verwendung in Cocktails
Jamaican Rum is essential for authentic tiki drinks, works excellently in blends with lighter rums, and brings incomparable aromatic depth to [[Daiquiri]]s and punches. Use it as an accent or as a star, depending on the intensity.
