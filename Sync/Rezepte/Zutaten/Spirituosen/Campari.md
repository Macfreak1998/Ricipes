# Campari

## Beschreibung
Campari is the iconic Italian bitter liqueur - bright red, intensely bitter, and absolutely indispensable for classic Italian cocktails. Produced in Milan since 1860, Campari is based on a secret recipe of herbs, aromatic plants, and fruits, macerated in alcohol and water. The characteristic ruby-red color originally came from cochineal insects, but today is produced with artificial colorants.

The taste of Campari is unmistakable and polarizing - intensely bitter with distinct orange notes, herbs, and a slight sweetness that balances the bitterness without dominating. At first sip, Campari can be challenging, but the complexity and balance make it the perfect ingredient for cocktails. The bitterness stimulates the appetite (hence its use as an aperitif) and creates fascinating contrasts with sweet and sour elements.

What makes Campari so valuable in cocktails is its ability to create depth and complexity without being heavy. A Negroni with Campari perfectly demonstrates how bitterness, sweetness, and botanical herb notes can work together. The alcohol content ranges from 20.5-28.5% ABV (depending on the market), with most markets receiving the 25% ABV version. Campari also works wonderfully with soda as a simple aperitif or in more complex tiki and classic cocktails.
