# Aged Rum

## Beschreibung
Aged Rum, sometimes also called Gold Rum or Amber Rum, represents the golden middle of the rum world - aged enough for complexity, but not as intense as the darkest variants. These rums spend several years in oak barrels, develop a golden to amber coloring, and show a beautiful balance between the sweetness of the molasses and the spicy notes of wood aging.

The aging typically takes place in former bourbon barrels, often in tropical climates where temperature extremes accelerate the interaction between rum and wood. A "5-year-old" rum from the Caribbean can taste like a much older whisky aged in a cooler climate due to the more intensive tropical aging. The barrels impart vanilla, toffee, spices, and gentle wood notes, while the rum retains its characteristic molasses sweetness.

In terms of taste, aged rums show wonderful complexity: think caramel, vanilla, roasted nuts, dried fruits, cinnamon, and nutmeg, underpinned by the characteristic rum sweetness. They are smoother than white rums but more vibrant than heavy dark rums. Most aged rums are 40% ABV, with some bottled at 43% or higher. This category is extremely versatile - excellent in cocktails and also enjoyable neat.
