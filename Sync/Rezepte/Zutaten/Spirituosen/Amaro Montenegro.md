# Amaro Montenegro

## Beschreibung

Amaro Montenegro is a classic Italian amaro from Bologna, produced since 1885 according to a secret recipe that includes over 40 different botanicals. The name "Montenegro" comes from Princess Elena of Montenegro, who married Italian King Vittorio Emanuele III in 1896, and the amaro was named in her honor. Montenegro is known for its particularly balanced character – it's less intensely bitter than Fernet, but more complex and interesting than sweeter amari.

The production of Amaro Montenegro is a complex process that combines multiple infusion methods. The botanicals are divided into three groups: some are cold-macerated in alcohol, others are extracted in warm alcohol, and yet others are distilled. These different extracts are then combined, sweetened with sugar and caramel, and aged in wooden barrels for several months. The botanical blend includes oranges (both sweet and bitter), coriander, cinnamon, marjoram, oregano, and gentian, among others. The finished amaro has 23% ABV and a dark amber color.

The taste of Amaro Montenegro is characterized by a harmonious balance between bitterness and sweetness. You'll find clear orange and citrus notes (both fresh and candied), vanilla, caramel, warm spices (cinnamon, coriander), and a medium herbal bitterness. The texture is relatively light and not too syrupy. The finish is pleasantly bitter, but not overwhelming. Many describe Montenegro as the "most beginner-friendly" of the classic Italian amari – it shows typical amaro characteristics, but is more accessible than more intense variants.

Amaro Montenegro is traditionally drunk in Italy as a digestif after meals, either neat, on ice, or lengthened with soda. In recent years it has also gained popularity in the cocktail world because its balanced nature makes it versatile.

## Verwendung in Cocktails

Amaro Montenegro is versatile in cocktails. In a Montenegro Spritz (with Prosecco and soda) it shows its refreshing, bitter side. As a modifier in spirit-forward drinks – half an ounce in an Old Fashioned or Manhattan – it adds orange complexity and balanced bitterness. In Negroni variations, Montenegro can replace Campari for a less aggressively bitter but still complex drink. It also works well in sour-style cocktails, where its bitterness complements citrus acidity. Many bartenders use it in split-base recipes with other amari to create depth. It harmonizes particularly well with Bourbon, Rye, or Rum. Even neat on ice with an orange peel, it's an excellent digestif.
