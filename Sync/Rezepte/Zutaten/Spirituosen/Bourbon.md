# Bourbon

## Beschreibung
Bourbon is America's native whiskey - a grain spirit with character, sweetness, and history. By law, bourbon must be produced in the USA and consist of a mash that contains at least 51% corn. Most bourbons use significantly more corn (often 70-80%), supplemented with rye or wheat as well as malted barley. This high corn content gives bourbon its characteristic sweetness.

What makes bourbon special is the aging in new, charred oak barrels. The fresh wood imparts intensive vanilla, caramel, and spice notes to the whiskey. The charring caramelizes the natural sugars in the wood and creates a sweet, smoky complexity. Bourbon must age for at least two years to be called "Straight Bourbon," with many premium products spending four to twelve years or longer in the barrel.

In terms of taste, bourbon shows a wonderful balance between sweet notes (caramel, vanilla, honey), spicy elements (cinnamon, nutmeg, pepper), and the woody influences of barrel aging. The alcohol content typically ranges from 40-50% ABV (80-100 proof), with "Bottled in Bond" bourbon legally required to be 50% ABV. This combination of sweetness and spice makes bourbon perfect for cocktails that need a robust, aromatic whiskey.
