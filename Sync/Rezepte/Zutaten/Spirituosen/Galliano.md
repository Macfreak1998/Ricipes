Galliano L'Autentico is an Italian herbal liqueur that was created in 1896 by Arturo Vaccari in Livorno and is named after the Italian war hero Giuseppe Galliano. The liqueur is immediately recognizable by its characteristic tall, slender bottle and its intense golden-yellow color. At about 42.3% alcohol, it belongs to the stronger liqueurs and presents a complex profile of over 30 herbs, spices, and botanicals.

The taste profile is dominated by vanilla and anise, complemented by notes of star anise, lavender, peppermint, cinnamon, and nutmeg. This combination results in a sweet, spicy, and slightly bitter character that distinctly differs from other herbal liqueurs. The vanilla note is particularly pronounced and gives Galliano its characteristic creaminess on the palate, while the anise component brings a certain freshness.

Production occurs through maceration and distillation of the various botanicals in separate batches, which are then carefully blended. The liqueur is traditionally distilled in copper stills, which contributes to the taste complexity. After distillation, the liqueur is mixed with sugar and natural colorants that give it its characteristic golden color.

In the cocktail world, Galliano is known primarily as an indispensable component of two classics: the Harvey Wallbanger (Vodka, Orange Juice, Galliano) from the 1970s and the Golden Dream. Modern bartenders also use the liqueur in smaller doses to bring depth and vanilla notes to various drinks. It works particularly well in combination with citrus, cream, and coffee notes. Due to its intensity, Galliano is often used sparingly - typically 0.25 to 0.75 oz per cocktail.
