# Beschreibung

Bénédictine D.O.M. is one of the oldest and most complex herbal liqueurs in the world, with a history that allegedly dates back to 1510, when Benedictine monks at the Abbey of Fécamp in Normandy developed a healing elixir. Modern production began in 1863 when Alexandre Le Grand rediscovered and commercialized the old recipe. The initials "D.O.M." stand for "Deo Optimo Maximo" (To God, Most Good, Most Great), a reference to its monastic origins.

The recipe for Bénédictine is a closely guarded secret, but it is known to contain 27 different herbs, spices, and plants, including angelica root, hyssop, juniper, myrrh, saffron, aloe, arnica, lemon balm, cinnamon, coriander, cloves, and many more. These ingredients are macerated, distilled, and then sweetened with honey and sugar before the liqueur ages in oak barrels. The result is an exceptionally complex liqueur at 40% ABV that combines sweet, spicy, herbal, and honey-like notes.

The taste of Bénédictine is hard to describe because it is so multifaceted. You find honey and caramel sweetness, followed by spicy notes (cinnamon, cloves), herbal flavors (angelica, hyssop), and a slight citrus brightness. The texture is syrupy but not overly thick, and the finish is long and warm with persistent spice notes. Compared to Chartreuse (another famous herbal liqueur), Bénédictine is sweeter and less intensely herbal, but still rich and complex.

Bénédictine can be drunk neat as a digestif, but is also an indispensable component of many classic cocktails. Its complexity and alcohol content make it more versatile than many other liqueurs - it functions both as a sweetener and as an aromatic modifier. There is also B&B (Bénédictine & Brandy), a pre-mixed liqueur that combines Bénédictine with Cognac for a drier, more spirit-forward version.

## Verwendung in Cocktails

Bénédictine is essential in classic cocktails such as the Vieux Carré (with Rye, Cognac, and Sweet Vermouth), Singapore Sling, and the Frisco Sour. In the Bobby Burns, it adds sweet herbal complexity to Scotch and Sweet Vermouth. Many modern bartenders use Bénédictine in small amounts (often just a barspoon or quarter-ounce) as a modifier in spirit-forward drinks, where it brings a mysterious, hard-to-identify depth. It works particularly well with dark spirits such as Whiskey, Cognac, and aged Rum. In Tiki drinks, a small amount of Bénédictine can add spice and honey sweetness. The honey character also makes it interesting in drinks with citrus, where it provides round sweetness instead of simple sugar.
