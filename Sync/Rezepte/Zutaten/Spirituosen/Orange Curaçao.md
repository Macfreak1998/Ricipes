# Orange Curaçao

## Beschreibung

Orange Curaçao is a traditional orange liqueur that originally comes from the Caribbean island of Curaçao, where a special type of bitter orange grows – the Laraha orange. These oranges are a mutated form of the Seville orange that adapted to Curaçao's dry climate and developed extremely bitter, aromatic peels. These peels are precisely the basis for authentic Curaçao, which has played an important role in the cocktail world since the 19th century.

There are different types of Curaçao that differ in color and sweetness level: Orange Curaçao (clear or lightly orange colored), Blue Curaçao (with blue food coloring), and Triple Sec (a drier variant). The taste is primarily characterized by bitter orange peels, with a distinct bitterness that is balanced with sugar. Compared to Cointreau or Grand Marnier, Curaçao is often somewhat sweeter, less refined, but also more authentic in the traditional sense.

The best-known producers are Senior & Co., who produce on Curaçao itself and use real Laraha oranges, and Pierre Ferrand Dry Curaçao, a modern, high-quality interpretation based on historical recipes. There are also many generic "Curaçao" products on the market that are simply flavored liqueurs without a real connection to the island or the Laraha oranges – the quality of these varies greatly.

Orange Curaçao typically has a lower alcohol content than Cointreau (often 25-30% ABV instead of 40%), which means it brings somewhat more sweetness and less spirit weight. In classic cocktails from the 19th and early 20th centuries, Curaçao was often the first choice for orange liqueur, before Triple Sec and Cointreau dominated the market.

## Verwendung in Cocktails

Orange Curaçao is the historically correct choice in many vintage cocktails such as the [[Mai Tai]] (Trader Vic specifically called for Orange Curaçao), the Classic Daiquiri No. 4, and various punches. In a Margarita it can replace Cointreau if you want a sweeter, more traditional variant. Pierre Ferrand Dry Curaçao is particularly popular in the craft cocktail scene because it combines historical authenticity with modern quality. Blue Curaçao is used primarily for its color – in drinks like the [[Blue Hawaiian]] or [[Blue Lagoon]] – although the taste is similar to Orange Curaçao. For authentic Tiki drinks, a good Orange Curaçao is often indispensable.

Popular cocktails:
- [[Mai Tai]]
