# Bonded Bourbon

## Beschreibung

Bottled in Bond Bourbon is a special category of American whiskey subject to strict legal requirements, which were established in 1897 in the Bottled in Bond Act. These regulations were originally introduced to protect consumers from inferior or adulterated spirits and to guarantee a quality standard. A bourbon may only be called "Bottled in Bond" if it meets four main criteria: it must come from a single distillery from a single distillation season, be at least four years old, be bottled at exactly 50% ABV (100 Proof), and mature in a federally supervised warehouse.

These requirements may sound technical, but they have practical effects on taste and quality. The 50% alcohol content means more intensity and body than standard bourbon at 40%, which is noticeable both when drinking neat and in cocktails. The fact that the bourbon comes from a single distillery and season guarantees consistency and character – it's not a blend from different sources. The four-year minimum maturation ensures that the bourbon had sufficient time to develop complexity from the barrel.

Bonded Bourbon typically shows the classic bourbon characteristics in concentrated form: caramel, vanilla, oak spice, and often a certain heat from the higher proof. Well-known examples are Old Forester Bottled in Bond, Rittenhouse Rye Bottled in Bond (technically a rye, but following the same rules), and Heaven Hill Bottled in Bond. These bourbons often offer excellent value for money because the legal requirements guarantee quality without having to pay for a premium brand name.

The higher proof makes Bonded Bourbon particularly interesting for cocktails. It can withstand more dilution from ice without losing its character, and its spice and intensity cut through sweet or tart mixers. Many classic whiskey cocktail recipes were originally developed with higher-proof whiskey before the industry switched to 40% as standard in the 1970s – Bonded Bourbon brings back this historical strength.

## Verwendung in Cocktails

Bottled in Bond Bourbon is ideal for any whiskey cocktail that needs some power. In an Old Fashioned it delivers intensity and stands up to dilution from ice. A Manhattan with Bonded Bourbon has more backbone and balance, especially when using sweet vermouth. In a Whiskey Sour, the higher proof means the bourbon character comes through alongside the citrus acidity. Even in highballs like Bourbon & Ginger, the whiskey taste remains present. Many bartenders prefer Bonded Bourbon for classic recipes because it corresponds to what was historically available. The 100 Proof standard also makes dosages simple and consistent.
