# Beschreibung

Cynar is an Italian amaro that was created in 1952 and is famous for its unusual main ingredient: artichokes. The name is derived from "Cynara scolymus," the Latin name for artichoke. While Cynar is made from 13 different herbs and plants, artichoke leaves are the characteristic ingredient that gives it its unique, slightly vegetal and earthy-bitter profile. Cynar is less sweet than many other amari and has a distinctly bitter, almost plant-like character.

The production of Cynar begins with the maceration of 13 herbs and plants in alcohol, with artichoke leaves playing the main role. Other botanicals are secret, but known ones are cardamom, cinnamon, and various bitter herbs. After maceration, the liqueur is lightly sweetened (less than many other amari) and then filtered. Cynar has 16.5% ABV (there is also Cynar 70 with 35% ABV, a more intense, less sweetened version) and a dark brown color.

The taste of Cynar is characterized by a pronounced bitterness with earthy, vegetal notes reminiscent of cooked artichokes, dark chocolate, and herbs. There are also subtle caramel and spice notes, but the bitterness and plant-like character dominate. Compared to sweeter amari such as Montenegro, Cynar is significantly more bitter and drier. This bitterness makes it particularly interesting as an aperitif - it stimulates the appetite and is refreshing without being too sweet.

Cynar had its heyday in the 1960s-70s in Italy, especially as an aperitif lengthened with soda. In recent years, the craft cocktail movement has rediscovered it because its unique bitterness and low alcohol content make it a versatile modifier. Cynar 70, the higher-proof version, is particularly popular with bartenders because it delivers more intense flavors at smaller volumes.

## Verwendung in Cocktails

Cynar is fantastic in a Cynar Spritz (with Prosecco and Soda), where its bitterness creates a refreshing, not-too-sweet aperitif. In a Boulevardier or Negroni, Cynar can replace or complement Campari for an earthy, less citrusy bitterness. The "Bitter Giuseppe" (Cynar, Sweet Vermouth, Lemon Peel) is a modern classic that puts Cynar's artichoke character in the foreground. As a modifier in spirit-forward drinks, half an ounce of Cynar adds an interesting, hard-to-identify bitterness. It works particularly well with Rye Whiskey, where its vegetal note complements the spicy rye flavors. Cynar also harmonizes well with Gin because both have botanical profiles. Neat on ice or lengthened with soda, it is an excellent digestif or aperitif.
