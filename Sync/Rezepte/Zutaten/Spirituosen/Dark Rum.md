# Dark Rum

## Beschreibung
Dark Rum is the bold, aromatic side of the rum world - deeply colored, rich in flavor, and full of personality. The dark color comes from longer barrel aging in charred oak barrels (often former bourbon barrels) and sometimes through the addition of caramel for color consistency. These rums show the full glory of molasses and wood aging.

Dark Rum can be produced in various ways. Some are primarily distilled in pot stills, which preserves more congeners (flavor compounds) and results in a fuller, heavier body. Others are blends of pot still and column still rums. Oak aging brings vanilla, caramel, and spice notes, while the molasses itself contributes deep, rich flavors of toffee, brown sugar, dried fruits, and sometimes even chocolate or coffee.

In terms of flavor, dark rums are complex and spicy - think cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, combined with sweet molasses notes and the woody influences of barrel aging. Jamaican dark rums tend to be "funky" and ester-rich, while Demerara rums from Guyana are often richer and sweeter. Most dark rums have 40-43% ABV, with navy strength variants at 57% ABV. Dark rum isn't just for cocktails - it also works excellently neat or on ice.

## Verwendung in Cocktails
Dark Rum is perfect for [[Dark 'n' Stormy]], [[Mai Tai]] (as part of the rum blend), tiki drinks that need depth, and classic punches. The spice and richness stands up beautifully against ginger, lime, and tropical fruits.
