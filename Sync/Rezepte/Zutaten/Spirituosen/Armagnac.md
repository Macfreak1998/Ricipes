# Armagnac

## Beschreibung
Armagnac is a worthy but less famous cousin of Cognac. While Armagnac is much older than Cognac (its first mention dates back to the 15th century, 1411), it is not as well-established outside of France as Cognac. Only a few varieties are available, and thus its audience is small. However, Armagnac connoisseurs are extremely loyal.

## Herstellung
Armagnac is produced in the Gascony region in specific areas near the Gers, Landes, and Lot-et-Garonne departments. Unlike Cognac, Armagnac is traditionally distilled in a small, inefficient *alambic armagnacais* (from the thinner wine of three grape varieties). The distillation produces a low-alcohol distillate, which is then aged in oak barrels or even sherry casks.

"The heart" (middle cut) of the distillation, separated from the first and last distillations, is called *la spice distillate* and is blended with neutral alcohol and diluted with distilled or demineralized water to 80° proof.

### The Three Growing Regions of Armagnac

1. **Bas Armagnac** (sandy soil): The best and largest, accounting for about 57% of production
2. **Ténarèze** (clay soil): Approximately 40% of production
3. **Haut Armagnac** (limestone soil): 3% of production

One of these appellations may appear on an Armagnac bottle label, but most labels state either "Appellation Armagnac" or "Appellation Bas Armagnac." The flavors of the three are very different.

### Reifung and Blending
The distillates from the three regions (sometimes only two) and different vintages are blended together to maintain consistency. Unlike Cognac, Armagnac bottles can carry vintage dates.

## Verwendung in Cocktails
Armagnac is typically considered richer and more robust than Cognac, but with less finesse. It is suitable for cocktails and can be enjoyed neat.
