# Tequila Blanco

## Beschreibung
Tequila Blanco, also called Silver or Plata, is unaged or minimally aged tequila - the purest expression of blue agave. By law, tequila must be produced from 100% blue Weber agave (Agave tequilana) from designated regions around Tequila, Jalisco. Blanco tequila is either bottled immediately after distillation or rests for a maximum of two months in stainless steel tanks or neutral containers.

What makes Blanco special is its clarity and directness. Without wood influence, you taste the true personality of the agave - grassy, peppery, sometimes slightly sweet with notes of citrus fruits and black pepper. Good Blancos show wonderful complexity: earthy undertones, floral nuances, and a pleasant sharpness. The best examples come from 100% agave tequilas (as opposed to "mixto" tequilas, which only require 51% agave).

Production begins with harvesting mature agaves (7-10 years old), whose hearts (piñas) are cooked, crushed, fermented, and double-distilled. This process preserves the characteristic agave flavors that make Blanco tequila the perfect cocktail spirit. The alcohol content is typically 38-40% ABV (76-80 proof), with some premium products bottled at 45% ABV or higher. The clear, powerful nature of Blanco makes it the first choice for Margaritas and other tequila cocktails where the agave character should shine through.
