# Maple Syrup

## Beschreibung
Maple Syrup is a natural sweetener obtained from the boiled sap of the sugar maple tree. It comes mainly from Canada and the northeastern United States.

Maple syrup is divided into various quality grades, from Golden (mild) to Very Dark (robust). For cocktails, Amber or Dark grade is usually best, as they have more flavor.

The taste is complex and sweet with caramel-like, woody, and slightly nutty notes. Maple syrup is thicker than simple sugar syrup and has approximately 67% sugar content.

## Verwendung in Cocktails
Maple Syrup is used in cocktails to add depth and complexity. It pairs particularly well with bourbon, rye whiskey, and dark spirits.

Popular Cocktails:
- [[Maple Old Fashioned]]
- [[Penicillin]] (as an alternative to Honey Syrup)
- [[New York Sour]] (variations)
- Autumn Whiskey Sours

**Tip:** In many recipes, Maple Syrup can be exchanged 1:1 with Honey Syrup.
