# Agave Nectar

## Beschreibung

Agave Nectar (also called Agave Syrup) is a natural sweetener obtained from the agave plant - the same plant from which Tequila and Mezcal are distilled.

Agave Nectar is produced by heating agave sap, which converts the starches into sugars. It's sweeter than regular sugar and has a lower glycemic index.

The taste is mildly sweet with light caramel-like notes, without the assertive taste of honey. The consistency is syrupy and dissolves easily in cold beverages.

There are Light and Dark Agave Nectar - Light is milder, Dark has more caramel notes. For most cocktails, Light Agave is preferred.

## Verwendung in Cocktails

Agave Nectar is the perfect choice for Tequila and Mezcal cocktails, as it comes from the same plant and harmoniously complements the flavors.

Popular Cocktails:
- [[Tommy's Margarita]] (uses Agave instead of Cointreau)
- [[Agave Daiquiri]]
- [[Oaxaca Old Fashioned]]
- All Margarita variations

**Dosage:** Agave is sweeter than Simple Syrup. As a rule of thumb: 3/4 oz Agave = 1 oz Simple Syrup.
