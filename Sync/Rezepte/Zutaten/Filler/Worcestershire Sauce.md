# Worcestershire Sauce

## Beschreibung
Worcestershire Sauce is a fermented seasoning sauce from England, developed in 1837 by Lea & Perrins. It contains a complex mixture of vinegar, molasses, sugar, salt, anchovies, tamarind, onions, and various spices.

The taste is umami-rich, spicy-sweet-sour with a slight heat. The sauce is fermented for at least 18 months in oak barrels, which develops its complexity.

The consistency is thin and dark brown. Worcestershire Sauce is a key ingredient for savory cocktails and gives them depth and spice.

## Verwendung in Cocktails
Worcestershire is dosed sparingly (in dashes) and is indispensable for the classic Bloody Mary and related drinks.
