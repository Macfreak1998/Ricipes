# Tonic Water

## Beschreibung
Tonic Water is a carbonated soft drink flavored with quinine. Quinine comes from the bark of the cinchona tree and gives tonic its characteristic bitter taste.

Originally, Tonic Water was drunk in British colonies to prevent malaria - the bitter taste was mitigated with gin, which led to the birth of the Gin & Tonic.

Modern Tonic Water contains significantly less quinine than historical versions, but is still noticeably bitter. There are many quality levels - from cheap supermarket tonic to premium brands like Fever-Tree, Thomas Henry, or Fentimans.

Premium tonics often have more complex flavors with citrus notes, herbs, and spices. Sugar content varies greatly - there are also light and zero variants.

## Verwendung in Cocktails
Tonic Water is the basis for all Gin & Tonic variations and is also used for other highballs.
