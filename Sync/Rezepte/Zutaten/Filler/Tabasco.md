## Beschreibung
Tabasco is a hot chili sauce made from fermented Tabasco chilies, vinegar, and salt. It was developed in 1868 by Edmund McIlhenny in Louisiana, USA, and is now the world's best-known hot sauce.

The sauce has approximately 2,500-5,000 Scoville (medium heat), a spicy-sour taste, and a characteristic thin, sprayable consistency.

Tabasco is available in various variants: Original Red, Green Jalapeño, Chipotle, Habanero, and more. For classic cocktails, the Original Red sauce is usually used.
